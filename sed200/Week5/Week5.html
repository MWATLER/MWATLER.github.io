<h2>Dealing with Ill-Defined and Open-Ended Problems</h2>

<p>An  ill-defined  problem  is  one  that  is  vaguely  or  ambiguously  formulated. 
  There are good reasons why engineering problems are initially poorly defined. 
  Even  when an engineering  problem has  been clearly  formulated and stated, it 
  will  be  open-ended,  in  the  sense  that  there  will  not  be  a  single  "correct"  solution. 
  Indeed,  a  characteristic  of engineering problems  is  that  there  are  alternative, 
  potentially  acceptable  solutions.  The  problem  is  not  to  find  "the"  solution  but 
  rather to find the "best" solution.</p>

<p>At  the  commencement  of  an  engineering  project,  the  initial  state  will  not  be 
  known precisely and the target state is still undefined. In some situations it may be 
  very  difficult  to  identify  the  required  target  state  and,  in  a  worst  case  scenario,  it 
  will  not  be  possible  to  know  whether  the  correct  engineering  decisions  have  been 
  made  until  the  project  has  been  completed. The  open-ended  nature  of 
  engineering work raises a number of important questions. In particular:  
<ul>
<li>how do  we solve  an open-ended  problem if there is  not  going to  be a unique, 
  correct solution? </li>
<li>how  can  we  know  if  we  have found  a  good  solution  to  an  open-ended 
  problem? </li>
<li>how do we go about identifying alternative solutions to an open-ended 
  problem?  </li>
</ul>
To find answers to such questions we need to look at problem-solving strategies.</p>

<h2>Methodology for Solving Open-Ended Problems</h2>

<p>In  engineering  work,  it  can  be  useful  to  draw  on  past  practice  for  ideas  for 
  solving  current  problems.  However,  it  is  dangerous  to  rely  exclusively  on  this 
  approach. Adaptation is always needed, because differences inevitably exist 
  between  past  and  present  engineering  problems,  and  great  care  must  be  exercised 
  to  ensure  that  these  differences  are  allowed  for.</p>

<p><b>Is it a good idea to keep a repository of reusable code?</b><br>
Answer: Yes, absolutely!
</p>
            
<h3>Problem-solving strategy</h3>

<p>When faced with a problem that is both ill-defined and open-ended, common sense 
  suggests  that  the  first  step  should  be  to  clarify  the  problem  and  re-state  it  in  clear 
  and  unambiguous  terms,  in  so  far  as  this  is  possible.  If  a  range  of  alternative 
  approaches  can  be  found,  after  the  problem  has  been  clearly  formulated,  then  the 
  initial instinct may well be to choose the most "obvious" one and develop this into 
  a solution.</p>

<p>On  reflection,  however,  it  becomes  clear  that  intuition  alone  will  not  lead 
  necessarily  to  the  best,  or  even  to  a  good,  solution.  Rather  than  concentrating 
  initially  on  a particular solution, it  is better to take just  the  opposite  approach  and 
  look for as many different solutions as possible, that are feasible and promising. To 
  be able to do this, we need to formulate the problem in general (not over-specific) 
  terms so that unusual but promising solutions are not excluded.</p>

<p><b>In software engineering terms, what do you call an approach where you assume an answer, then 
  work backwards to see if the answer is correct?</b><br>
Answer: A heuristic algorithm. Also referred to as an NP problem. See
<a href="https://optimization.mccormick.northwestern.edu/index.php/Heuristic_algorithms" target="_blank">Heuristic algorithms</a>
</p>
 

<p>Our  search  for  unusual  but  promising  ideas  will  not  be  successful  if  we  use 
  convergent  thinking  and  rely  on  an  analytic  approach.  We  need  to  use  divergent, 
  lateral thinking. Creativity is extremely important because we are seeking unusual, 
  non-routine solutions.</p>

<p>If we are successful in creating a range of different and promising solutions to 
  our problem,  our  next task  is to  evaluate them,  compare  and rank them  and hence 
  identify  the best  approach.  These  simple  thoughts  lead  to  a  problem-solving 
  strategy  which  can  be  applied  to  poorly  formulated,  open-ended  problems.  The 
  steps are listed below.</p>

<img src="SolvingProblems.PNG" alt="Strategy for Solving Problems">

<p><b>With such an approach, would it be useful to assign numbers to each criteria and a weighting factor for each criteria?</b><br>
Answer: Yes, that is often what's done.
</p>

<h3>Methodology for complex engineering problems</h3>

<p>The  strategy  above  will  be  appropriate  for  relatively  simple,  open-ended 
  problems  where  it  is  easy  to  evaluate  and  compare  the  alternative  options.  This 
  may  be  the  case  in  simple  activity  planning  tasks.  If,  however,  the  problem  has 
  many,  relatively  complex,  alternative  solutions  (and  this  is  typically  the  case  in 
  engineering work) then an enormous amount  of  effort would have to  be  expended 
  in the third step. A  full set of designs and plans would have to be created for each 
  approach. This would be extremely time consuming, costly and inefficient, because 
  it would mean solving the detailed problem many times, once for each option. </p>

<img src="PyramidGiza.PNG" alt="Pyramid of Giza">

<p>The  costs  in  time  and 
  effort  in  the  planning  and  design  phases  can  be  reduced  enormously  if,  instead  of 
  fully  evaluating  every  option,  we  use  an  incremental  approach,  and  start  with 
  simple  and  rough  comparisons  of  the  options.  On  the  basis  of  quite  limited 
  information it will usually be possible to identify and eliminate the less 
  competitive  options.  This  first  step  is  not  costly  because  we  are  using  simple, 
  approximate,  order-of-magnitude  calculations.  A  second,  rather  more  detailed, 
  evaluation of the remaining options then allows a further cull  to be made.</p>

<p>Proceeding  step-by-step  in  this  way,  we  eventually  identify  a  single  best 
  option.  If not,  we  will at  least have  a short list of the  most  promising  options  and 
  we  can  then  proceed  to  a  final  round  of  comparisons  in  which  we  use  the  most 
  accurate analyses and calculations. With  this  methodology  we  substantially  reduce  the  total  amount  of  effort. 
  Furthermore,  the  more  detailed  calculations  are  made  for  the  more  promising 
  options. The steps in this modified methodology are listed below.</p>

  <img src="SolvingProblems2.PNG" alt="Strategy for Solving Problems, more detailed">

<h3>Iteration</h3>

<p>As  the  design  and  planning  work 
  proceeds, it will often become clear that a modification, improvement or correction 
  is  needed  in  one  or  more  of  the  steps  already  completed.  In  Step  4,  for  example, 
  when  a  new  and  unusual,  but  promising,  approach  is  being  evaluated,  it  might  be 
  found  that  the  original  problem  statement  in  Step  1  is  unnecessarily  restrictive. 
  Rather than staying rigorously with  the  original  problem statement  it is best to  go 
  back and restate the  problem in a more encompassing way,  as our aim is to obtain 
  the  best  solution.  Likewise,  when  alternatives  are  being  compared  and  ranked  in 
  Steps  5  and  6,  it  might  become  clear  that  an  improved  problem  statement  will 
  allow improvements to be made to some of the approaches.</p>

  <h2>Engineering Planning</h2>

<p>A  methodology  for  undertaking  engineering  planning  is  shown  below.  It 
  follows  closely  the  problem-solving  methodology  listed above  but  typical 
  feedback loops have been added to emphasise the need for iteration. </p>  

<img src="EngineeringPlanning.PNG" alt="Engineering Planning">

<p>The  overall  aim  of  the  initial  problem  formulation  phase  is  to  clarify  and,  if 
  possible,  quantify  the  problem.  </p>

<p>The  <i>feasibility  study</i>  is  the  second  phase  of  the  process.  This 
  term  emphasises  that  there  might  not  be  a  feasible  solution.  The  desired  outcome 
  from  this  step  is  of  course  a  short  list  of  acceptable  approaches,  which  will 
  demonstrate  feasibility.  </p>

<p><b>What greatly helps a feasibility study?</b><br>
Answer: A working prototype.
</p>

<p>In  the  third  phase  of  the  process, <i>preliminary  planning</i>,  further  rounds  of 
  comparisons  and  evaluations  are  carried  out,  in  order  to  identify  the  best  option. 
  The comparisons now require more detailed analysis and evaluation than 
  previously.  If  one  of  the  alternatives  stands  out  clearly  from  the  others,  then  the 
  preliminary  planning  phase  can  be  quickly  and  easily  completed.  On  the  other 
  hand,  if  the  alternatives  are  closely  matched,  this  phase  can  become  protracted 
  because of the need for increasingly detailed comparisons.</p>

<p>The purpose of the <i>detailed planning</i> phase is to take the best option, when it 
  has  been  identified,  and  develop  it  to  work  out  all  of  the  details    needed  to 
  undertake  the  implementation.  If  much  analysis  and  evaluation  work  has  already 
  gone  into  identifying  the  best  option,  then  there  will  be  correspondingly  less 
  detailed  planning  work  needed.  The  end  result  of  this  phase  is  a  detailed  plan  for 
  implementation. However, this might still not be the final plan. Problems can arise 
  during  implementation  that  make  it  necessary  to  revisit  some  of  the  earlier  steps. 
  Indeed,  the  plan  will  not  be  finalised  until  the  project  is  completed. </p>

<p>The  last  phase, <i>implementation</i>,  may  require  the  construction  or  manufacture  
  of  new  components  of  infrastructure  or  the  implementation  of  new  processes.  At 
  first  sight,  implementation  may  seem  to  be  a  separate  part  of  the  project,  to  be 
  undertaken when the planning and design work has been completed. This is not so. 
  Whatever form the implementation takes, it is almost always necessary to return to 
  and revise some of the earlier planning work.</p>
<p><b>Which is more costly, to fix a mistake in the problem formulation, or a mistake in implementation?</b><br>
Answer: problem formulation, because you have to make modifications to all the steps below it.
</p>

<p><b>What percentage of the schedule is spent on Design? Implementation? Testing and Rework?</b><br>
Answer: 20% design, 40% implementation, 40% testing and rework.
</p>

<p><b>How true are these ratios with the assignments you have done so far?</b><br>
Answer: 40-20-40, 30-30-40, etc...
</p>

<p><b>When you look at the approach to design so far, which project management methodology is more suitable, 
  the <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sdlc/sdlc_waterfall_model.htm" target="_blank"> waterfall</a> model or the 
  <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sdlc/sdlc_agile_model.htm" target="_blank">agile</a> model?</b><br>
Answer: For small projects, waterfall is more suitable. For large projects, agile is more suitable, but 
  the waterfall model can be used in sub-components of the project.
</p>

<p><b>Within your own company, which departments do you think you have to consult with, while working out the 
  design and implementation of the project?</b><br>
  Answer: Marketing, manufacturing...</p>

<h2>The Design Process</h2>

<p>The design process shown below parallels the process of engineering planning shown above,  
  although  there  are  some  differences  in  terminology. The emphasis here is on finding 
  alternative  concepts,  or  design  options,  rather  than  on  investigating  feasibility. 
  Despite this difference in wording, the aim of the second phase is the same in both 
  design and  planning: to  produce a short list of the best feasible options for solving 
  the problem.</p>

  <img src="DesignProcess.PNG" alt="The Design Process">

<p>The most general, far-reaching and financially most important design 
decisions  are  made  in  the  initial  stages  of  the  concept  design,  when  new,  original 
and  unusual  approaches  are  sought.  As  the  design  proceeds  towards  the  detailed 
phase,  the  design  decisions  become  more  and  more  specific,  and  they  have  less 
impact on overall costs.</p>

<p>The purpose  of  the  preliminary  design  phase  is  to  study  the  short-listed  concepts  in 
  sufficient detail to allow the best concept to be identified. If it is difficult to choose 
  from  several very  good  concepts,  then  successive  rounds  of  calculations  and 
  comparisons  of  increasing  complexity  are  needed.  These  studies  may  become,  in 
  effect, detailed designs. It is not unusual for the preliminary design phase to blend 
  into the detailed design phase, with detailed designs being carried out for several of 
  the very best options. </p>

<p>In  the  detailed  design  phase,  the  aim  is  to  take  the  best  approach,  now 
  identified, and generate all the information needed to allow full implementation.  If 
  one  concept  has  been  clearly  identified  at  an  early  stage  as  the    best,  then  a  fair 
  amount  of  additional,  detailed  work  will  be  required  in  this  phase.  On  the  other 
  hand, the effort needed in the detailed design is correspondingly reduced when the 
  chosen concept has already been investigated in some detail.</p>

<p><i>Something  which  is  often  forgotten  or  misunderstood  is  that  the  vast  majority 
  of  the  work  involved  in  design  is  finding  out  what  the  problem  really  is -  and 
  it's  rarely  what  you  think  it  is.  More  often  than  not  the  client  is  asking  the 
  wrong question. Once you've found out what the problem really is, then things 
  virtually design themselves because you've so comprehensively understood the 
  problem that the solution is self-evident.</i></p>

<h2>Problem Formulation Phase in Planning and Design</h2>

<p>The table  below  contains  a  checklist  of  actions  that  can  assist  in  the  problem-
  formulation  phase  of  engineering  planning  and  design. Some  of  the  actions  are  information-gathering 
  activities  while  others  are  aimed  at  formulating  and,  to  the  extent  possible  at  this 
  stage, quantifying the problem.</p>

<img src="ActionsProblemSolving.PNG" alt="Actions for Problem Solving">

<h3>Identifying the problem as part of a wider problem</h3>

<p>An  engineering  project  can  begin  as  a  response  to 
  perceived  needs  in  the  community,  and  the  objectives  may  be  initially  poorly 
  defined.  The  problem  as  stated  may  be  too  vague;  alternatively,  the  problem  may 
  be  stated  in  over-precise  terms  which  imply  an  "obvious"  solution.  In  the  latter 
  case, the implied  solution will rarely  be the  only  possible one, and may not be the 
  best one. It is therefore important to begin the problem formulation phase by trying 
  to identify the problem as part of a wider or larger problem.</p>

<p><b>A remote village in South America was identified as one requiring a well. The villagers had to walk for 
  at least half an hour to a nearby river and bring water back to the village. A social worker therefore 
  initiated the construction of a well for the villagers. The villagers did not use the well. Why?</b><br>
Answer: It turns out these villagers met members of other villages at the river. The trip to the 
river was not just for water. It provided a social function.
</p>
<p><b>A remote village in South America was having a mild problem with famine. A social worker received funds 
  to aid to assist in the resolution of this problem. Instead of buying more seed and better farm equipment, 
  the social worker decided to let the villagers decide how to overcome this problem. They took the funds and 
  cleared out a field, put two goal posts at either side, and had soccer games instead. Do you think this 
  worked in alleviating the food problem?</b><br>
Answer: Actually it did. The leaders of the village noted the low morale of the villagers and figured 
weekly soccer games would go far to improving their social cohesion. As a natural result, they worked more 
effectively in the fields during the week and food production improved.
</p>
  
<h3>Identifying each engineering system as a component of a wider system</h3>

<p>To assist in identifying the  problem  as  part of a wider problem, it can be useful to 
  identify  the  relevant  engineering  system  as  a  component  of  a  larger  or  wider 
  system.</p>

<h3>Identifying interest boundaries for the problem </h3>

<p>How  far  should  the  process  of  problem  broadening  be  taken? At  some  stage  the  
  problem  broadening argument breaks down. How do we recognise this stage? The questions cease 
  to be relevant  when they are  so  broad that  new  issues will barely  influence the  problem 
  statement.  This  occurs  when  the  expanded  system  is  so  large  that  the  original 
  problem  (in  this  case,  the  need  for  a  bridge,  or  some  alternative)  ceases  to  be 
  relevant. When this happens, we have clearly gone too far. The limit, where the problem has been widened to the extent that the original 
  problem  is  of  marginal  relevance,  is  referred  to  as  the  interest  boundary  for  the 
  problem.  The  relevant  solution  options  will  be  found  within  this  boundary.</p>

<p>The construction of a large bridge in a small country can become an 
  international issue. An example was the K-B Bridge in Palau, a small island nation 
  in  the  Western  Pacific,  somewhat  less  than  a  thousand  kilometres  west  of  the 
  Philippines.  The  bridge  was  constructed  in  the  1970s  with  aid  money  from  the
  United  States  when  Palau  was  its  protectorate.  At  the  time,  the  bridge  was  the 
  largest  prestressed  concrete  box-girder  cantilever  arch  construction  in  the  world, 
  linking the two main islands of  Korror and  Babeldaob.  It served a  crucial purpose 
  for  the  whole  population  of Palau because essential  services, including the airport 
  and  power  generation  equipment,  were  located  on  one  island  while  most  of  the 
  population  lived on  the  other.  The bridge  collapsed  suddenly  and  apparently 
  without warning in July 1996, shortly after it had undergone extensive 
  refurbishment. Life in Palau was severely disrupted, even though a ferry 
  connection was established  between  the islands.  The construction of  a  new  bridge 
  was  clearly  beyond  the  resources  of  Palau  and  had  to  wait  until  it  could  be 
  undertaken with international aid. The interest boundary in this case extended well 
  beyond national boundaries.</p>

<img src="PalauBridge.PNG" alt="The Palau Bridge">

<p>In summary, the problem-broadening process should be halted when a further 
  widening  of  the  boundary  has  only  a  marginal  impact  on  the  original  problem 
  statement. The interest boundary can be identified in this way.</p>

<h3>Determining the real underlying needs as distinct from the stated needs</h3>

<p>The real needs that initiate an engineering project are not always those that are
  initially perceived. The process of problem widening and the identification of the
  engineering system as a component in a wider system usually lead to a better
  understanding of the real needs. In situations where the size and scope and influence 
  of a project are limited, it may be much easier to identify the relevant underlying 
  needs. The attempt to identify underlying needs sometimes moves attention away
  from purely technical problems towards social issues and political problems,
  especially when the proposed work is large in magnitude and costly. This is almost
  inevitable if large sums of public money are to be spent. As the problem-widening
  and system-widening processes are undertaken, the questions acquire an
  increasingly political and social flavour and require community input.</p>

<h3>Gathering relevant background information</h3>

<p>When work commences on a new project there is usually a lack of relevant
  background information. This has to be gathered as early as possible, and before
  the problem formulation phase is completed. The required information may be
  scientific and technological, but it may also be non-technical and sociological,
  legal or political in nature. The data-gathering exercise may require consultation
  with the community, the use of libraries, the internet, textbooks, and databases.</p>

<h3>Searching for side effects</h3>

<p>Each engineering project is designed to bring about some change in the world in
  which we live. Although the intention is to improve the infrastructure and thereby
  satisfy some community and individual needs, it is inevitable that there will be side
  effects. These may be obvious and desirable, but also hidden and undesirable. They
  may only become evident after a considerable period of time, when the project has
  been completed and is in operation. In the case of a large-scale project there will
  usually be a wide range of side effects, some beneficial and some detrimental.</p>

<p>The identification of side effects should begin as early as possible during
  problem formulation but should continue into the evaluation stages because some
  side effects will depend on the chosen solution. It is clearly important that the
  relevant side effects be identified and allowed for when the costs and effectiveness
  of each alternative approach is evaluated.</p>

<h3>Identifying constraints</h3>

<p>It is important in the problem formulation phase to identify the constraints that
  apply to the problem. Constraints restrict the possible solutions to a problem, and
  arise in various ways. They may be technical, legal, economic, social,
  environmental or political in nature. Monetary cost is a constraint that applies in
  one way or another to every engineering project. Constraints arise if certain side
  effects are unacceptable or undesirable, such as excessive atmospheric pollution.
  Technological limitations create other constraints. Legally enforceable industry 
  standards are often the means by which constraints arise in engineering design.
  Design constraints may be introduced for the different components that make up a 
  system so that they fit together and work in harmony with each other.
  Constraints can sometimes be quantified as physical limits or as minimum performance
  requirements which must be achieved.</p>

<img src="WaterfallGully.PNG" alt="Identifying Constraints: Power supply for Waterfall Gully">

<h3>Defining objectives and identifying conflicts among objectives</h3>

<p>It is important to have a clear and unambiguous statement of the goals and
  objectives of any engineering project. This is, in effect, a statement of the problem,
  and of what is to be achieved. While it is important to clarify the initial problem
  statement, it can be advantageous not to finalise it until at least some of the
  background information has been collected. In particular the process of identifying
  relevant systems as components of larger systems and identifying the problem as
  part of a larger problem can assist in identifying the objectives.</p>

<p>Furthermore, engineering projects usually do not have just one, but rather a
  number of different objectives, and some objectives are very likely to conflict with
  others. The twin requirements of maximum performance and minimum cost are
  always going to be in conflict. It is always necessary to identify potential conflicts
  among the objectives.</p>

<h3>Specifying design criteria, performance requirements and operating conditions</h3>

  <p>The goals and objectives of a project are expanded, clarified and quantified
    through the use of design criteria. Performance requirements and operating
    conditions are used jointly to specify how the system that is to be created must
    perform. These are used both in the detailed phases of planning and design, and in
    the preliminary phases to evaluate and rank alternative approaches and concepts.</p>

<p>Clear and unambiguous statements of goals, objectives, design criteria and
  performance requirements are particularly important should the completed project
  or system not reach expectations, with resulting legal dispute.
  Safety and reliability are further performance requirements which require very
  careful consideration</p>

<h3>Devising measures of effectiveness</h3>

<p>The goals and objectives of a project are expanded, clarified and quantified
  through the measures of effectiveness, which are used in the feasibility study phase
  of project planning and in the preliminary and the detailed design phases. When a
  project has more than one objective, one or more measures of effectiveness are
  needed for each specific objective, and ideally with an overall measure that takes
  account of the different objectives.</p>

<p>Total cost is often appropriate as the overall measure of effectiveness. This is
  the case if the various objectives can be stated in terms of equivalent cost. Overall
  cost is also appropriate if the various objectives can be reformulated as minimum
  performance requirements, or as constraints that have to be satisfied. Not all
  situations lend themselves to monetary evaluation. For example, the measures of
  effectiveness might need to take account of matters such as aesthetics,
  environmental effects, risk of injury and loss of life.</p>

<h3>Iterating</h3>

<p>The various activities occurring within the problem formulation
  phase may need to be undertaken iteratively. The type of
  background information that is required becomes progressively clearer after some
  attempt has been made to identify side effects and constraints and possible
  approaches. Likewise, some of the constraints and side effects are more easily
  recognised after some background information has been gathered. It will also be
  necessary to return to the problem formulation phase as we proceed through the
  later phases of planning and design.</p>

  <h2>FEASIBILITY STUDY AND CONCEPT DESIGN</h2>

<p>The purpose of the feasibility study in planning is to show that the project can be
  carried out successfully. When a short list of promising alternative approaches has
  been identified, any one could form the basis of a solution. Likewise, the aim of
  the concept design phase is to establish a short list of promising concepts, each of
  which may result in a successful engineering design.</p>

<p>It is emphasised that it is best to begin with a wide a range of alternatives. We
  have seen how each option can be investigated superficially in order to cull nonfeasible
  and non-competitive candidates. A further study, with a somewhat more
  detailed analysis of each option, leads to a further culling. The culling continues,
  using additional information, until there is a short list of feasible, promising
  options. A list of steps that can be useful in the feasibility study and in concept
  design is shown in Table 3.4. The steps are discussed below.</p>  

<img src="FeasibilityStudy.PNG" alt="Checklist for a feasibility study">

<h3>Checking available resources</h3>

<p>Resources are used up in the course of an engineering project and an initial check
  is needed to ensure that sufficient resources will in fact be available. Resource
  availability (or non-availability) can determine the viability of particular options,
  so that this check should be undertaken with all alternative concepts and
  approaches in mind.</p>

<p>It is necessary to consider human, financial and technical resources, as well as
  any special materials and machinery that will be needed during implementation.
  Engineering expertise and scientific knowledge are resources, as are relevant trade
  and craft skills. Specialised design and analysis skills may be required. Time is a
  resource because engineering work always has to be completed within a limited
  time frame.</p>

<h3>Investigating and quantifying the constraints</h3>

<p>The technical and other constraints that have been identified in the problem
  formulation phase have to be investigated and, if possible, quantified. Some
  constraints are legal-technical, and are quantified in codes and standards and in
  legislation. In the design of a large city building, constraints on overall height,
  minimum services for water, sewerage, fire protection, thermal and acoustic
  insulation and even vertical transport, are imposed through the relevant ordinances
  and building acts.</p>

<h3>Developing as many promising concepts as possible</h3>

<p>This is the key step in the entire processes of engineering planning, design and
  problem solving. The success of any design or planning work depends on the
  range, quality and appropriateness of the approaches and options that are
  generated. As already emphasised, diversity in the alternatives is important.
  Innovative and creative new approaches, as well as traditional and proven ones,
  should be included in the initial list of alternatives. It is by no means clear whether
  an innovative new approach or a well-tried standard approach will eventually
  prove to be best. Both types need to be investigated.</p>

<h3>Comparing alternative concepts and progressively eliminating non-competitive
  approaches</h3>

<p>The preliminary comparison of the options, made using simple calculations and
  preliminary information, will allow the poorer options to be culled.
  In further rounds of comparisons, the increased accuracy of the analysis and
  design calculations lead to more refined comparisons and further culls.</p>

<h3>Modifying the problem formulation as necessary</h3>

<p>The need for an iterative approach throughout the problem solving process has
  been emphasised. Modification of the original problem statement may be needed
  during the feasibility study. As work proceeds and new and unusual approaches are
  considered and investigated, the understanding of the problem is inevitably
  improved, so that a better formulation of the problem may be possible. New and
  unexpected approaches can challenge the validity of the original problem
  statement, particularly in regard to the measures of effectiveness that are used to
  compare and evaluate the alternatives.</p>

<h3>Scrapping or deferring the project if no feasible approaches can be found</h3>

<p>If none of the options are feasible, perhaps because they do not satisfy constraints
  relating to time, cost or resources, then the project cannot proceed. It might be best
  to cancel the project, or to defer it until technical knowledge has improved to the
  level needed, or until additional resources become available. Another possibility is
  to look for new, innovative approaches that will make the project feasible. Yet
  another possibility is to reformulate the problem with different, more modest goals
  and less severe constraints.</p>

<h2>PRELIMINARY PLANNING AND DESIGN</h2>

<p>The purpose in this phase is to bring the search for the best option to a positive
  conclusion and to identify the approach that will lead to the best solution of the
  problem. Each short-listed option is investigated in turn and in sufficient detail to
  allow comparisons and rankings to be made, using the measures of effectiveness.</p>
<p>Even at this stage, very accurate comparisons are avoided if at all possible
  because of the cost implications. On the other hand, if alternatives are eliminated
  on insufficient grounds, the most appropriate alternative might also be incorrectly
  eliminated. The step-by-step approach therefore continues until all but one of the
  alternatives are eliminated.</p>
<p>Although attention is focused on the original options that emerged from the
  feasibility study, the search for new and better alternatives should not be
  discontinued. Modifications to existing approaches should be made in the later
  stages of the process if improvements are achieved. As work proceeds, there can be
  a build up in expertise which can lead, even at this stage, to further improvements
  and changes to the original problem statement and to the measures of effectiveness,
  as well as to new or modified design or planning concepts.</p>

<h2>DETAILED PLANNING AND DESIGN</h2>

<p>The aim now is to work out the details of the solution that are needed for full
  implementation. Accurate calculations are needed in the detailed phase. But even here,
  iteration may become necessary, for example to develop alternative trial details for
  some components. If adjustments are made to the design details, with the aim of
  improving performance or decreasing cost, a new analysis might be needed to
  check whether the improvements have in fact been achieved. Such iterations
  continue until an effective and economical design or plan has been achieved, that
  meets all the requirements.</p>
<p>It is in the detailed phase of planning and design that optimisation techniques
  may be employed. If the behaviour of a component lends itself to theoretical
  modelling, it should be possible to improve the design by mathematically
  optimising the parameters that define or characterise the component. The process
  of optimisation is discussed in some detail in Chapter 13, together with various
  mathematical optimisation techniques.</p>
<p>At all stages of the detailed design, checks are made that the design
  constraints are not violated. In some situations overly severe constraints may add
  disproportionately to the cost or detract from the effectiveness of a solution. Even
  during the detailed planning and design phase it may be advisable to modify
  decisions made previously in the problem formulation phase.</p>
<p>In the detailed design of the components of a system, the primary focus
  should be on the overall operation and cost of the parent system. If the design of a
  component has a disproportionate effect on overall cost and effectiveness, then
  modifications may be possible for this component and for the interacting
  components, so that an improved overall design is achieved. If components are to
  be manufactured in quantity it may be desirable, depending on the nature and
  expected cost of the component and the number to be produced, to construct
  prototypes and test and modify them as an adjunct, or alternative, to the theoretical
  analyses.</p>

<p>The important final step in the detailed design and planning phase is full
  documentation, with a permanent record of relevant calculations and analyses and
  any other investigations that have been used to produce the final plan or design.</p>

<h2>IMPLEMENTATION</h2>

<p>Implementation of a plan, a design or a solution to an engineering problem can
  take many forms, depending on the context of the work. Special engineering fields
  with their own undergraduate programs and text books are devoted to the different
  types of implementation, such as construction engineering and manufacturing
  engineering.</p>
<p>Poor engineering design occurs when inadequate consideration is given to
  how the design is to be implemented. Constructability is an important criterion that
  is too often forgotten in the structural design of buildings. An undue focus on
  optimum design can lead to an elegant design with a minimum use of materials,
  but exorbitant construction costs.</p>
<p>We have specifically mentioned (if only briefly) the implementation phase
  here as a reminder of its importance in the overall scheme of planning and design.</p>

<h2>THE SOLUTION-FIRST STRATEGY</h2>

<p>To emphasise the fact that alternative sequences may be appropriate in some
  circumstances, we now discuss briefly a solution-first strategy. Numerous examples can be found
  in the history of engineering where an important project has not commenced with
  the identification of a problem but, on the contrary, has started with a potential
  solution. The task is then to search for an appropriate problem. A good technical
  idea may arise from some technical or scientific development, or by bringing new,
  potentially useful knowledge from another field of engineering.</p>

<img src="SolutionsFirst.PNG" alt="Solution-first approach to problem solving">

<p>Ideas may arise concerning applications of new materials with unusual and
  useful properties that have been developed in non-engineering fields. Such
  scenarios lead to the search for possible applications of new ideas.</p>

<p>The solution-first approach shown in the above Figure applies to such situations. A
  specific solution is the starting point to the procedure. This again
  emphasises the important point that engineering problem solving is an iterative
  activity. The entry point to the process is not of prime importance.</p>

<p>In a similar vein, Rogers (1983) has argued that answers often precede
  questions. He has suggested that while organisations face many problems, they
  typically possess only limited knowledge of a few innovations that can offer
  solutions. The chance of identifying an innovation to cope with a specific problem
  is therefore small. However, by commencing with an innovative solution there is a
  good chance that it can be matched to some problem facing the organisation.
  According to Rogers, a strategy for organisations is thus to scan for innovations
  and to try to line up a promising innovation with relevant problems.</p>

<h2>OTHER ASPECTS OF PLANNING AND DESIGN</h2>

<h3>Risk, safety and failure</h3>

<p>Once the goals and objectives of an engineering project have been established, the
  expectation is that they will in fact be achieved. However, engineering work
  inevitably involves some uncertainty and risk, and the possibility always exists that
  a system or a component will not perform as expected, or indeed that the entire
  project will not fulfil all of its objectives. When any engineering work is
  undertaken there is a risk of failure that, although small, is real and unavoidable.
  However, the levels of risk are controllable to some extent, and can be reduced to
  very small values that are acceptable to the community.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the term "failure" can mean different things to
  different people, and within the context of engineering work, it can be used with
  different meanings in different contexts. From the designer's point of view, a 
  practical and useful engineering approach is to say that failure occurs if the 
  performance of the system does not meet the performance levels that were set for 
  it. These performance levels are carefully chosen during the design process when 
  the minimum performance requirements, the design criteria and the effectiveness 
  measures are identified.</p>
<p>In regard to an engineering project, we can say that failure occurs if the aims
  and objectives of the project are not substantially achieved. Another quite different
  kind of engineering failure can occur if unintended, unpredicted and unacceptable
  side effects arise from the engineering work. Such failures can arise from errors
  made in the initial investigation stages of the project and from an incomplete and
  inadequate understanding of the problem.</p>
<p>Irrespective of the way we choose to define failure, there can be many
  different possible forms, or "modes", of failure to consider. Furthermore, the
  consequences of the different failure modes can vary enormously.</p>
<p>In any project, the designer must identify the possible modes of failure,
  evaluate the likely consequences of each mode, and design the system so that there
  is an acceptably low risk of failure appropriate for each mode. The level of risk
  that is acceptable will depend on the mode of failure and on the consequences of
  the failure.</p>

<h2>INTRACTABLE PROBLEMS AND SYSTEMS</h2>

<p>It has been observed that some real world problems are too ill-structured to be
  dealt with using the standard systems approach. These have been described as
  <i>wicked problems</i>, as distinct from the <i>docile problems</i> that are amenable to
  standard approaches (Rittel and Weber, 1993). Wicked problems usually have a
  strong human dimension, for example when a number of individuals and groups of
  people are closely involved, both in the problem itself and in defining and finding
  an acceptable solution.</p>
<p>It has also been suggested that some real world systems do not lend
  themselves to standard planning and design techniques. A distinction has been
  drawn between <i>hard systems</i>, for which the procedures described in this book are
  applicable, and <i>soft systems</i>, which are intractable. Soft systems have been
  described as highly complex, lacking any clear structure, and possibly containing
  uncoordinated sub-systems that pursue their own independent goals. Again, such
  problem systems usually have a human dimension. A <i>soft systems methodology</i> has
  been developed by Checkland (1984) and his co-workers at the University of
  Lancaster for dealing with complex, intractable problems that are related to soft
  systems. It has also been suggested that the self-contained, limited, engineering
  project may not be the best way to deal with soft systems, and that alternative
  approaches may be more successful.</p>

<h3>Wicked problems</h3>

<p>Wicked problems have been discussed since the 1970s in regard to social planning
  and management problems that involve human activity, and more recently in
  regard to engineering planning, design and management. there is an important human 
  element in most modern engineering work, and community consultation and community 
  input normally lead to acceptable decisions and successful outcomes. On the rare occasions when this is
  not the case, problems can become wicked, and this is usually because conflicting
  views and opinions in the community. According to Rittel and Weber (1993),
  wicked problems cannot be adequately formulated because additional relevant
  aspects are continually brought up for consideration. They suggest that a solution
  only occurs when a decision is made that the current trial solution is "good
  enough". It follows that there is no correct or best solution to a wicked problem,
  only that alternative solutions can be identified, compared and ranked. They also
  consider that each wicked problem will be unique, and that each wicked problem
  will lead to another problem.</p>
<p>Perhaps inevitably, sub-classifications of wicked problems have been
  proposed: super-wicked problems have been defined as wicked problems which
  have serious time constraints imposed on them, and which are partly caused by the
  same people that are dealing with the problem. The term "mess" was introduced by
  Ackhoff (1974) to describe a set of inter-related problems, or a system of
  problems. Further information on wicked problems and social messes can be found
  in the book by Ritchey (2011).</p>

<p>Various strategies have been proposed for dealing with wicked and intractable
  problems. When a problem is made intractable by the involvement of many
  paticipants with opposing views, an authorative approach may be possible. A
  small group of carefully chosen people, including experts, is given the
  responsibility of coming up with a solution. This approach is time-efficient
  because it sidesteps the need to deal in detail with the competing views and beliefs
  of the interested parties; however, it relies on the perspectives and experience of
  the group of people chosen to deal with the problem. An entirely different
  approach is to invite solutions from all persons and parties involved with the
  problem, and then to evaluate them and identify the best one. This is an
  adversarial approach. It can lead to tensions in the community and mutual distrust.
  A compromise approach has also been proposed, whereby an attempt is made to
  include all people who are likely to be affected, and to achieve collaboration using
  meetings and discussions to clarify the issues among competing interests. This
  approach will be very time consuming, but can lead to a solution that will be
  satisfactory to the majority of people, optimal for a few, and unsatisfactory for a
  minority. Compensation is always an added option for dealing with those
  significantly disadvantaged by a project.</p>
<p>In important engineering projects it is certainly true that very large numbers of
  people become involved, in one way or another. When different interested groups
  hold entrenched views, the project can take on a political dimension so that the
  engineering problems display the characteristics of wicked problems. Community
  consultations and negotiations then become very important, but may require
  additional political input.</p>

<h3>Soft systems methodology</h3>

<p>Checkland (1984) and his research group at Lancaster University in the United
  Kingdom, and other researchers, drew a distinction between hard systems and soft
  systems. Hard systems are relatively well-defined and lend themselves to
  traditional evaluation and analysis using the procedures presented in this book. In
  contrast, soft systems are ill defined and possibly indefinable because individuals
  and groups of people with differing views become involved and do not agree on
  what constitutes the system and the purpose of the system, nor on the problem that
  is to be solved. The idea of soft systems was originally developed in regard to
  problems in management and business, but is applicable to some engineering
  problems, particularly those which involve opposing views with political and
  sociological elements.</p>

<h3>Agile software development</h3>

<p>If engineering problems and systems become intractable, it is usually because there
  are social, political and business issues to be resolved. But this is not always the
  case. Developers of large, complex, computer software packages have found that
  traditional planning and design approaches are inappropriate because of the
  extreme complexity of the systems being developed, and the length of time needed
  to create the complete, final plan or program, and then bring it into operation.
  Multi-purpose, multi-faceted software packages are quite different to, say, a piece
  of engineering hardware, such as a bridge, which must be brought into use as a
  complete entity. In contrast, various parts of a large software package can be
  developed, delivered and put into use long before the complete package has been
  conceived, let alone created. Some business software packages fall into this
  category. In their final form, these packages gather enormous amounts of data that
  fluctuate second by second; they then process, evaluate and analyse the data and so
  provide rapidly changing advice concerning the financial markets.</p>

<p>An alternative, <i>agile approach</i> to software development has become popular,
  which allows solutions to evolve progressively and adaptively, with different teams
  working simultaneously on coding diverse parts of the package. The emphasis is
  on the early production of working software and the regular delivery of additional
  components. Close collaboration among the teams of developers is obviously
  necessary. However, the approach also encourages close contact between the
  developers and the end users of the package. Furthermore, it allows changes to be
  made to the overall requirements and function of the package, even at late stages of
  development. This is an adaptive approach in which, initially, there is no accurate
  statement of the requirements of the end product. On the contrary, the requirements
  can change and develop over time and as the detailed work progresses.</p>
<p>This is a radical departure from the traditional methodology in which
  implementation begins as the detailed planning and design come to an end. Some
  proponents of the agile approach have emphasised that they are not promoting a
  different methodology, but rather the principles of a different approach.</p>
<p>The origins of agile thinking in software development can be traced back to
  the latter decades of the 20th Century, but the approach gained real momentum at
  the beginning of the new century, when varying views on agile principles (and
  even including a manifesto) were presented on the internet and published
  (Highsmith et al 2001). Generally speaking, the agile approach incorporates the
  following ideas:
<ul>
  <li>customer satisfaction is to be achieved by the early and frequent delivery of
  useful software;</li>
<li>working software is the main measure of progress;</li>
<li>adaptability is paramount, allowing requirements to change, even in the late
  stages of a project;</li>
<li>close co-operation is needed, not only among the teams developing different
  parts of the software package, but also between users and developers; and</li>
<li>teamwork and good communication are essential among the self-organising
  development teams that progressively produce the architecture and overall
  requirements.</li>  
</ul></p>

<p>In summary, the agile approach emphasises an adaptive, iterative and
  evolutionary approach to software development, rather than the traditional
  sequential approach of plan-design-implement.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, many procedures have been used in implementing the agile
  approach. We will consider just one, called <i>scrum</i>, which is used to manage the
  work of a software development team. The aim is quick delivery of software, with
  an ability to respond rapidly to changes in requirements, to emerging technologies,
  and to changing user requirements (Schwaber and Beedle, 2002). The word
  "scrum" comes from the game of rugby football. In the scrum approach, a small
  team works closely together to produce new software components on a continuing,
  regular basis. Various roles are allocated to the team members. There is a product
  owner, who represents the interests of the customer or end user, but is also
  responsible for communication. The scrum master is the facilitator. A small team,
  usually of three to nine people, undertakes the development of software
  increments.</p>

<p>Work is undertaken in short sprints which typically last just several weeks,
  the aim being to produce useable software by the end of each sprint. A planning
  meeting is held at the start of the sprint to clarify the aims and the detailed work to
  be undertaken. A short stand-up meeting is held daily during the sprint and this is
  called a scrum. Each team member reports on progress made since the previous
  scrum, on the proposed work for the coming day, and, importantly, on any
  impediments that have been encountered.</p>
<p>Further detailed information on the scrum method, and on other agile
  methods, are to be found on the internet. Of course, problems have inevitably been
  experienced in the introduction of the agile approach, some of which have been
  documented. One recurring difficulty is accurate budgeting for an agile based
  project.</p>  

<h3>Agile management methods in engineering</h3>  

<p>It has been suggested that agile methods may be useful outside of software
  development and in engineering management and business management. The agile
  approach has been proposed for use in the automated development of engineering
  products such as computers, motor vehicles and medical devices. A suggested
  advantage of the agile approach in management is that it is much easier to deal
  with change and with unexpected occurrences when work is organised in short
  sprints. It is too early to judge how successful agile methods will prove to be in
  traditional engineering management applications. New engineering applications of
  the agile approach will be followed with interest.</p>
<p>A potential problem in applying the agile approach, and one not to be
  underestimated, is how to achieve a smooth and successful changeover from one
  mode of operation to another. Even when significant advantages are to be found in
  employing an agile approach, a too-rapid change in the management approach
  would cause disruption in any organisation. Careful planning for the changeover
  would be essential. A useful approach might be a step-by-step "hybrid" alternative,
  in which some suitable parts of the project are chosen and managed using agile
  principles. Components of both approaches could in fact be cherry-picked to obtain
  advantages from both approaches</p>
