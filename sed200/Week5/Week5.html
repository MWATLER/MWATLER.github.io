<h2>Dealing with Ill-Defined and Open-Ended Problems</h2>

<p>An  ill-defined  problem  is  one  that  is  vaguely  or  ambiguously  formulated. 
  There are good reasons why engineering problems are initially poorly defined. 
  Even  when an engineering  problem has  been clearly  formulated and stated, it 
  will  be  open-ended,  in  the  sense  that  there  will  not  be  a  single  “correct”  solution. 
  Indeed,  a  characteristic  of engineering problems  is  that  there  are  alternative, 
  potentially  acceptable  solutions.  The  problem  is  not  to  find  “the”  solution  but 
  rather to find the “best” solution.</p>

<p>At  the  commencement  of  an  engineering  project,  the  initial  state  will  not  be 
  known precisely and the target state is still undefined. In some situations it may be 
  very  difficult  to  identify  the  required  target  state  and,  in  a  worst  case  scenario,  it 
  will  not  be  possible  to  know  whether  the  correct  engineering  decisions  have  been 
  made  until  the  project  has  been  completed. The  open-ended  nature  of 
  engineering work raises a number of important questions. In particular:  
<ul>
<li>how do  we solve  an open-ended  problem if there is  not  going to  be a unique, 
  correct solution? </li>
<li>how  can  we  know  if  we  have found  a  good  solution  to  an  open-ended 
  problem? </li>
<li>how do we go about identifying alternative solutions to an open-ended 
  problem?  </li>
</ul>
To find answers to such questions we need to look at problem-solving strategies.</p>

<h2>Methodology for Solving Open-Ended Problems</h2>

<p>In  engineering  work,  it  can  be  useful  to  draw  on  past  practice  for  ideas  for 
  solving  current  problems.  However,  it  is  dangerous  to  rely  exclusively  on  this 
  approach. Adaptation is always needed, because differences inevitably exist 
  between  past  and  present  engineering  problems,  and  great  care  must  be  exercised 
  to  ensure  that  these  differences  are  allowed  for.</p>

<h3>Problem-solving strategy</h3>

<p>When faced with a problem that is both ill-defined and open-ended, common sense 
  suggests  that  the  first  step  should  be  to  clarify  the  problem  and  re-state  it  in  clear 
  and  unambiguous  terms,  in  so  far  as  this  is  possible.  If  a  range  of  alternative 
  approaches  can  be  found,  after  the  problem  has  been  clearly  formulated,  then  the 
  initial instinct may well be to choose the most “obvious” one and develop this into 
  a solution.</p>

<p>On  reflection,  however,  it  becomes  clear  that  intuition  alone  will  not  lead 
  necessarily  to  the  best,  or  even  to  a  good,  solution.  Rather  than  concentrating 
  initially  on  a particular solution, it  is better to take just  the  opposite  approach  and 
  look for as many different solutions as possible, that are feasible and promising. To 
  be able to do this, we need to formulate the problem in general (not over-specific) 
  terms so that unusual but promising solutions are not excluded.</p>

<p>Our  search  for  unusual  but  promising  ideas  will  not  be  successful  if  we  use 
  convergent  thinking  and  rely  on  an  analytic  approach.  We  need  to  use  divergent, 
  lateral thinking. Creativity is extremely important because we are seeking unusual, 
  non-routine solutions.</p>

<p>If we are successful in creating a range of different and promising solutions to 
  our problem,  our  next task  is to  evaluate them,  compare  and rank them  and hence 
  identify  the best  approach.  These  simple  thoughts  lead  to  a  problem-solving 
  strategy  which  can  be  applied  to  poorly  formulated,  open-ended  problems.  The 
  steps are listed below.</p>

<img src="SolvingProblems.PNG" alt="Strategy for Solving Problems">

<h3>Methodology for complex engineering problems</h3>

<p>The  strategy  above  will  be  appropriate  for  relatively  simple,  open-ended 
  problems  where  it  is  easy  to  evaluate  and  compare  the  alternative  options.  This 
  may  be  the  case  in  simple  activity  planning  tasks.  If,  however,  the  problem  has 
  many,  relatively  complex,  alternative  solutions  (and  this  is  typically  the  case  in 
  engineering work) then an enormous amount  of  effort would have to  be  expended 
  in the third step. A  full set of designs and plans would have to be created for each 
  approach. This would be extremely time consuming, costly and inefficient, because 
  it would mean solving the detailed problem many times, once for each option. </p>

<img src="PyramidGiza.PNG" alt="Pyramid of Giza">

<p>The  costs  in  time  and 
  effort  in  the  planning  and  design  phases  can  be  reduced  enormously  if,  instead  of 
  fully  evaluating  every  option,  we  use  an  incremental  approach,  and  start  with 
  simple  and  rough  comparisons  of  the  options.  On  the  basis  of  quite  limited 
  information it will usually be possible to identify and eliminate the less 
  competitive  options.  This  first  step  is  not  costly  because  we  are  using  simple, 
  approximate,  order-of-magnitude  calculations.  A  second,  rather  more  detailed, 
  evaluation of the remaining options then allows a further cull  to be made.</p>

<p>Proceeding  step-by-step  in  this  way,  we  eventually  identify  a  single  best 
  option.  If not,  we  will at  least have  a short list of the  most  promising  options  and 
  we  can  then  proceed  to  a  final  round  of  comparisons  in  which  we  use  the  most 
  accurate analyses and calculations. With  this  methodology  we  substantially  reduce  the  total  amount  of  effort. 
  Furthermore,  the  more  detailed  calculations  are  made  for  the  more  promising 
  options. The steps in this modified methodology are listed below.</p>

  <img src="SolvingProblems2.PNG" alt="Strategy for Solving Problems, more detailed">

<h3>Iteration</h3>

<p>As  the  design  and  planning  work 
  proceeds, it will often become clear that a modification, improvement or correction 
  is  needed  in  one  or  more  of  the  steps  already  completed.  In  Step  4,  for  example, 
  when  a  new  and  unusual,  but  promising,  approach  is  being  evaluated,  it  might  be 
  found  that  the  original  problem  statement  in  Step  1  is  unnecessarily  restrictive. 
  Rather than staying rigorously with  the  original  problem statement  it is best to  go 
  back and restate the  problem in a more encompassing way,  as our aim is to obtain 
  the  best  solution.  Likewise,  when  alternatives  are  being  compared  and  ranked  in 
  Steps  5  and  6,  it  might  become  clear  that  an  improved  problem  statement  will 
  allow improvements to be made to some of the approaches.</p>

  <h2>Engineering Planning</h2>

<p>A  methodology  for  undertaking  engineering  planning  is  shown  below.  It 
  follows  closely  the  problem-solving  methodology  listed above  but  typical 
  feedback loops have been added to emphasise the need for iteration. </p>  

<img src="EngineeringPlanning.PNG" alt="Engineering Planning">

<p>The  overall  aim  of  the  initial  problem  formulation  phase  is  to  clarify  and,  if 
  possible,  quantify  the  problem.  </p>

<p>The  <i>feasibility  study</i>  is  the  second  phase  of  the  process.  This 
  term  emphasises  that  there  might  not  be  a  feasible  solution.  The  desired  outcome 
  from  this  step  is  of  course  a  short  list  of  acceptable  approaches,  which  will 
  demonstrate  feasibility.  </p>

<p>In  the  third  phase  of  the  process, <i>preliminary  planning</i>,  further  rounds  of 
  comparisons  and  evaluations  are  carried  out,  in  order  to  identify  the  best  option. 
  The comparisons now require more detailed analysis and evaluation than 
  previously.  If  one  of  the  alternatives  stands  out  clearly  from  the  others,  then  the 
  preliminary  planning  phase  can  be  quickly  and  easily  completed.  On  the  other 
  hand,  if  the  alternatives  are  closely  matched,  this  phase  can  become  protracted 
  because of the need for increasingly detailed comparisons.</p>

<p>The purpose of the <i>detailed planning</i> phase is to take the best option, when it 
  has  been  identified,  and  develop  it  to  work  out  all  of  the  details    needed  to 
  undertake  the  implementation.  If  much  analysis  and  evaluation  work  has  already 
  gone  into  identifying  the  best  option,  then  there  will  be  correspondingly  less 
  detailed  planning  work  needed.  The  end  result  of  this  phase  is  a  detailed  plan  for 
  implementation. However, this might still not be the final plan. Problems can arise 
  during  implementation  that  make  it  necessary  to  revisit  some  of  the  earlier  steps. 
  Indeed,  the  plan  will  not  be  finalised  until  the  project  is  completed. </p>

<p>The  last  phase, <i>implementation</i>,  may  require  the  construction  or  manufacture  
  of  new  components  of  infrastructure  or  the  implementation  of  new  processes.  At 
  first  sight,  implementation  may  seem  to  be  a  separate  part  of  the  project,  to  be 
  undertaken when the planning and design work has been completed. This is not so. 
  Whatever form the implementation takes, it is almost always necessary to return to 
  and revise some of the earlier planning work.</p>

<h2>The Design Process</h2>

<p>The design process shown below parallels the process of engineering planning shown above,  
  although  there  are  some  differences  in  terminology. The emphasis here is on finding 
  alternative  concepts,  or  design  options,  rather  than  on  investigating  feasibility. 
  Despite this difference in wording, the aim of the second phase is the same in both 
  design and  planning: to  produce a short list of the best feasible options for solving 
  the problem.</p>

  <img src="DesignProcess.PNG" alt="The Design Process">

  <p>The most general, far-reaching and financially most important design 
    decisions  are  made  in  the  initial  stages  of  the  concept  design,  when  new,  original 
    and  unusual  approaches  are  sought.  As  the  design  proceeds  towards  the  detailed 
    phase,  the  design  decisions  become  more  and  more  specific,  and  they  have  less 
    impact on overall costs.</p>

<p>The The most general, far-reaching and financially most important design 
decisions  are  made  in  the  initial  stages  of  the  concept  design,  when  new,  original 
and  unusual  approaches  are  sought.  As  the  design  proceeds  towards  the  detailed 
phase,  the  design  decisions  become  more  and  more  specific,  and  they  have  less 
impact on overall costs.</p>

<p>The purpose  of  the  preliminary  design  phase  is  to  study  the  short-listed  concepts  in 
  sufficient detail to allow the best concept to be identified. If it is difficult to choose 
  from  several very  good  concepts,  then  successive  rounds  of  calculations  and 
  comparisons  of  increasing  complexity  are  needed.  These  studies  may  become,  in 
  effect, detailed designs. It is not unusual for the preliminary design phase to blend 
  into the detailed design phase, with detailed designs being carried out for several of 
  the very best options. </p>

<p>In  the  detailed  design  phase,  the  aim  is  to  take  the  best  approach,  now 
  identified, and generate all the information needed to allow full implementation.  If 
  one  concept  has  been  clearly  identified  at  an  early  stage  as  the  best,  then  a  fair 
  amount  of  additional,  detailed  work  will  be  required  in  this  phase.  On  the  other 
  hand, the effort needed in the detailed design is correspondingly reduced when the 
  chosen concept has already been investigated in some detail.</p>

<p><i>Something  which  is  often  forgotten  or  misunderstood  is  that  the  vast  majority 
  of  the  work  involved  in  design  is  finding  out  what  the  problem  really  is–  and 
  it’s  rarely  what  you  think  it  is.  More  often  than  not  the  client  is  asking  the 
  wrong question. Once you’ve found out what the problem really is, then things 
  virtually design themselves because you’ve so comprehensively understood the 
  problem that the solution is self-evident.</i></p>

<h2>Problem Formulation Phase in Planning and Design</h2>

<p>The table  below  contains  a  checklist  of  actions  that  can  assist  in  the  problem-
  formulation  phase  of  engineering  planning  and  design. Some  of  the  actions  are  information-gathering 
  activities  while  others  are  aimed  at  formulating  and,  to  the  extent  possible  at  this 
  stage, quantifying the problem.</p>

<h3>Identifying the problem as part of a wider problem</h3>

<p>An  engineering  project  can  begin  as  a  response  to 
  perceived  needs  in  the  community,  and  the  objectives  may  be  initially  poorly 
  defined.  The  problem  as  stated  may  be  too  vague;  alternatively,  the  problem  may 
  be  stated  in  over-precise  terms  which  imply  an  “obvious”  solution.  In  the  latter 
  case, the implied  solution will rarely  be the  only  possible one, and may not be the 
  best one. It is therefore important to begin the problem formulation phase by trying 
  to identify the problem as part of a wider or larger problem.</p>

<h3>Identifying each engineering system as a component of a wider system</h3>

<p>To assist in identifying the  problem  as  part of a wider problem, it can be useful to 
  identify  the  relevant  engineering  system  as  a  component  of  a  larger  or  wider 
  system.</p>

<h3>Identifying interest boundaries for the problem </h3>

<p>How  far  should  the  process  of  problem  broadening  be  taken? At  some  stage  the  
  problem  broadening argument breaks down. How do we recognise this stage? The questions cease 
  to be relevant  when they are  so  broad that  new  issues will barely  influence the  problem 
  statement.  This  occurs  when  the  expanded  system  is  so  large  that  the  original 
  problem  (in  this  case,  the  need  for  a  bridge,  or  some  alternative)  ceases  to  be 
  relevant. When this happens, we have clearly gone too far. The limit, where the problem has been widened to the extent that the original 
  problem  is  of  marginal  relevance,  is  referred  to  as  the  interest  boundary  for  the 
  problem.  The  relevant  solution  options  will  be  found  within  this  boundary.</p>

<p>The construction of a large bridge in a small country can become an 
  international issue. An example was the K-B Bridge in Palau, a small island nation 
  in  the  Western  Pacific,  somewhat  less  than  a  thousand  kilometres  west  of  the 
  Philippines.  The  bridge  was  constructed  in  the  1970s  with  aid  money  from  the
  United  States  when  Palau  was  its  protectorate.  At  the  time,  the  bridge  was  the 
  largest  prestressed  concrete  box-girder  cantilever  arch  construction  in  the  world, 
  linking the two main islands of  Korror and  Babeldaob.  It served a  crucial purpose 
  for  the  whole  population  of Palau because essential  services, including the airport 
  and  power  generation  equipment,  were  located  on  one  island  while  most  of  the 
  population  lived on  the  other.  The bridge  collapsed  suddenly  and  apparently 
  without warning in July 1996, shortly after it had undergone extensive 
  refurbishment. Life in Palau was severely disrupted, even though a ferry 
  connection was established  between  the islands.  The construction of  a  new  bridge 
  was  clearly  beyond  the  resources  of  Palau  and  had  to  wait  until  it  could  be 
  undertaken with international aid. The interest boundary in this case extended well 
  beyond national boundaries.</p>

<img src="PalauBridge.PNG" alt="The Palau Bridge">

<p>In summary, the problem-broadening process should be halted when a further 
  widening  of  the  boundary  has  only  a  marginal  impact  on  the  original  problem 
  statement. The interest boundary can be identified in this way.</p>

<h3>Determining the real underlying needs as distinct from the stated needs</h3>
