<h1>Week 9 - Teamwork</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Teamwork involves the full effective use of the skills of all individuals.
  Skills that are required in managing day-to-day activities and
provide the basis for undertaking many basic engineering activities such as
planning, design and construction are also described. Managing conflict, time
management and effective communication are skills for successfully undertaking
an engineering project.</p>

<h2>HUMAN NEEDS</h2>

<p>All engineers require some management expertise to undertake engineering work.
  The planning, design and construction of projects, the innovative design of
  engineering systems, practical problem solving, managing operations of large
  engineering water and energy utilities and decision-making at all levels of an
  organisation require the management of the needs of a large number of individuals.
  Many engineers will work as project managers where the role is to manage people
  and resources committed to a project to ensure that it is completed on time and
  within budget. The needs of each individual in a project group affect the operation
  of the group, so much so, that the needs and tasks of both the individual and the
  group need to be considered together.</p>

<p>Maslow (1970) developed his Hierarchy of Needs, shown in the table below, upon which many
  management researchers based their work. Maslow and researchers who followed developed models
  of the reasons for an individual’s work behaviour. Note that these are only models and, in reality,
  human beings are very complex creatures who have many different aspirations that
  drive them. Maslow’s theory suggests that, as a person satisfies one level of need,
  then behaviour is motivated to meet the next level of need. This theory has been
  built upon to explain people and organizational needs of today with various
  alternative variations of the five levels evolving.</p>

  <img src="HierarchyOfNeeds.PNG" alt="Abraham Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs">

  <h2>WORKING IN GROUPS AND TEAMS</h2>

  <p>A group is a term which is vague in concept and can be any number of individuals
    who interact together. A team may be a group of people who work well together to
    achieve a common goal. Effective teams must have members who are willing and
    able to complete the task set, as well as work in a team environment. The size of
    effective teams has always been somewhat subjective because large tasks need
    large teams, but generally teams should be small enough to maintain efficient
    communication and coordination among the team members. Larger groups will
    always break into smaller informal groups to allow effective contributions from all
    members.</p>

<p>The three circles model of Adair (1983), shown in the figure below, illustrates the
  three areas of needs in any group or team. Adair does not take credit for the model
  and its origin is unknown. It has been proposed (Johnson and Johnson, 2000) that
  one of the keys to human development has been the ability to form and work in
  small effective groups. Groups are central to much of human life and engineering
  is no exception.</p>  

<img src="ThreeCircles.PNG" alt="Three Circles Model">

  <p>Effective groups are a force to be reckoned with; however, not all groups are
    effective and this can lead to significant problems. According to Johnson and
    Johnson (2000), an effective group
  <ul>
<li>achieves its goals (task);</li>
<li>maintains good working relationships among members; and</li>
<li>adapts to changing conditions in the surrounding organization, society and
    world.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>At present the trend is
  for more group work rather than less. A Fortune 1000 survey in 1993 found that
  91% of companies had implemented some form of team working (up from 70% in
  1987), and in Australia in 1991, 47% of manufacturing companies had employees
  in teams (up from 8% in 1988). This means that engineers will not only work in groups and teams but in all
  likelihood take some form of leadership role in them as well, given that engineers
  are more likely to be in senior positions. For this reason it is important to know
  how teams work and, more importantly, to know what to do when they start to
  break down. The below figure shows some of the group activities undertaken in the problem
  solving processes and the interpersonal processes that involve group maintenance
  and self oriented behaviours.</p>

<img src="GroupEffectiveness.PNG" alt="Group Effectiveness">

<h2>LEADERSHIP</h2>

<p>Teams need a leader to succeed. An effort should be made to designate
  someone to play that role at or before the first meeting. Sometimes a person is
  appointed to the leadership role because of their place in the organisation.
  However, there is no need for that leader to be permanent and omnipotent. The
  leader needs to ensure that the task and maintenance functions of the three circles
  model are performed. The roles of the members within the group can be decided by
  natural aptitudes for different functional roles or different people can be assigned
  to take on functions akin to their particular styles. Belbin (1981) outlined eight
  roles that any member of a group prefers to operate in, as shown in Table 6.3. This
  was later extended to nine roles with a specialist type added.</p>

<img src="ThreeCircles.PNG" alt="Proposed Team Roles">

<p>The <u>Coordinator/Chairperson</u> takes the responsibility of keeping people on
  track, and pays attention to group processes. This person, with the help of the
<u>Team Worker/Supporter</u>, ensures that all members participate and notices when
  someone is upset. However, it is apparent that when both a <u>Shaper</u> and a
<u>Coordinator</u> work in a team, one of them has to adopt a secondary preferred role.</p>

<p>The <u>Resource Investigator</u> can also act as a person who serves as liaison
  between the team and the rest of the world. In the context of groups at university,
  this person interacts with the academic supervisor and other groups. We all learn
  from others but mostly from our own experience. It can be said that someone with
  a modest amount of natural ability, who works hard at observing the member
  interactions of group maintenance and self oriented behaviours, as well as the task
  and problem solving process, will forge ahead of a person of high natural ability
  who relies on instincts and never addresses his or her faults. To understand the
  principles of leadership and to work hard at them will ensure success. As Adair
  (1983) stated: “Good leadership is often so silent, so self-effacing, that you are
  hardly aware of it, but bad leadership always shouts at you.”</p>

<h3>Laws of Leadership</h3>

<p>A leader needs vision, discipline and wisdom (Newman, 1994). Vision shows that
  the leader knows what the long-term goal is and discipline is used to ensure that
  energy, time and resources are directed to achieve the goal. Wisdom can be
  considered to be the ability to apply knowledge and experience to any situation.</p>

<p>The leader also shows courage when different situations demand it. How
  does one create courage? The answer is as Mark Twain said: “Courage is a
  resistance to fear, mastery of fear—not absence of fear.” To make some difficult
  decisions requires courage and this decision-making ability is an attribute that is
  needed by a leader. The leader empowers others to make decisions, as the team
  depends on all members contributing to the process of achieving the designated
  goal.</p>
<p>Friendships and humility are developed throughout one’s career. Being a
  good listener and trusted confidante helps in mentoring the team, in avoiding
  rivalry and in producing the best outcomes. In each person's career there are times
  when it is necessary to have someone to open up to and ideally that person is the
  leader. No one survives alone. In developing such relationships a leader must
  exercise tact and diplomacy, and show impartiality. The leader must be prepared to
  learn from those within the team and those outside the team to produce the best
  outcome. Ideally a leader will exude inspirational power and enthusiasm and
  encourage team members to do their best. A leader’s role is to serve the team so
  that the team will be able to say, “We did this ourselves”.</p>

<h2>BEHAVIOURAL STYLES OF INDIVIDUALS</h2>

<p>There are
  many possible ways of classifying individual personalities. One way is according
  to the kinds of tasks that the person likes to take on: (leader, innovator, or keeper
  of the peace among many others). A search in the literature and the Internet can
  yield many free tests to discover what preferences of behavioural style an
  individual has. It is important to note here that there is no ‘right’ personality. The
  main task is to recognize the differences among team members and to work with
  the team members, rather than have them work against the team.</p>

<h3>DISC Behavioural Styles</h3>

<p>DISC follows a theory developed by Dr W.M. Marston in 1928 and further
  developed in the 1940s (Cole and Tuzinski, 2003). This theory suggests that a
  person’s preferred behavioural style falls into one of four categories. Although all
  four styles will usually be displayed by a single person, one style tends to describe
  the person's behaviour better than the others. DISC does not measure skills,
  experience, values, intelligence, beliefs or knowledge. DISC behavioural styles are
  shown below.</p>

<img src="DISCStyles.PNG" alt="DISC Behavioural Styles">

<p>The four styles are determined from whether behaviour is direct or indirect
  and whether behaviour is oriented towards tasks and results, or people and ideas.
  All styles are necessary and valuable. The descriptors help us to clarify differences
  in people and remove barriers to improve communication. By determining whether
  another person is direct or indirect, task-oriented or people-oriented, one can
  develop a better relationship and better communication with that person. Tests that
  can be used to assess behavioural style can be found on the Internet so that an
  allocation to one of Direct (Eagle), Influencing (Parrot), Supportive (Dove) and
  Conscientious (Owl) can be made.</p>

<h3>Direct Style? Faster or Slower Paced</h3>

<p>Some people are direct and work quickly, take risks, are forceful, talkative and
tend to make decisions quickly. The Dominant Director and Influencing Persuasive
types fit into the category of direct styles, as shown in the figure below. The 
indirect styles are quieter, patient, cooperative, more cautious and easy-going.
Figure 6.3 DISC Personality types and their simple characteristics.
They are good listeners and tend to take their time in making decisions and
take fewer risks. Examples of indirect types include the Supporter and
Conscientious styles.</p>

<img src="DISCPersonalityTypes.PNG" alt="DISC Personality Types">

<h3>People and ideas or tasks and results?</h3>

<p>People who are relationship-oriented are generally open, appreciative and
  supportive, and find it easy to make friends. These people can be enthusiastic and
  can share their feelings. They tend to go with the flow in a relaxed manner. The
  Steady Supporter (S) and Influencing (I) styles stress people and ideas. They tend
  to promote harmony. The other types of people seem to be biased to task and
  results. This type likes structure, procedures, guidelines and facts. They prefer to
  get to the point and do not like their time wasted. They usually take a considerable
  time to show their warm side and tend to keep their feelings to themselves.</p>
<p>Note that no one operates entirely in one quadrant and we all tend to have a
  mixture of all the styles in different percentages. Each style has weaknesses and it
  is important to be aware of our own weaknesses so that we can improve in those
  areas. One style will be the dominant style of an individual, although in different
  situations other styles may well be used. Is the dominant style Direct or Indirect? Is
  there a preference for tasks and results, or people and ideas? Are people who have
  similar or different characteristics easier to get along with? Why?</p>

<h3>Eagle (Direct)</h3>
  
<p>The eagle personality is decisive and strong willed. Eagles are keen to get to the
  point and quickly. They are adventurous, take risks and are forceful. At work
  eagles are results orientated, but to be easier to work with, eagles should do more
  listening and improve their consideration of others. In various other typologies, this
  personality has been labelled as a Bear, Lion, Guardian and Controller.</p>

  <h3>Parrot (Influencing)</h3>
  
<p>The parrot is enthusiastic and likes to express emotions. Parrots are talkative,
  optimistic and confident. In groups they are persuasive and gregarious. Parrots
  need to pay more attention to detail and improve their follow-through on tasks. In
  various other typologies, this personality has been labelled as a Monkey, Otter,
  Artisan and Promoter.</p>

<h3>Dove (Supportive)</h3>
  
  <p>The dove is dependable, diplomatic, patient and a team player. Doves like to get
  results, are stable, good listeners and are sincere and patient. However, they could
  work at coping with change and improve their decision-making ability. In various
  other typologies, this personality has been labelled as a Dolphin, Golden Retriever,
  Philosopher and Supporter.</p>

<h3>Owl (Conscientious)</h3>
  
  <p>The owl personality is orderly, cautious and reserved. Owls have high standards,
  are careful, analytical, diplomatic and accurate. They could, however, open up
  more and attempt to move out of their comfort zone if they are to make more
  impact on their team. In various other typologies, this personality has been labelled
  as a Beaver, Scientist and Analyst.</p>

<h2>GROUP AND TEAM DEVELOPMENT</h2>

<h3>Stages in team development</h3>

<p>When teams come together to undertake a specific task, it has been found that they
  tend to go through a series of quite well-defined stages. In 1965, Tuckman
  developed a model that had four stages of forming, norming, storming and
  performing. Some stages are very productive, some less so. It is important to
  realise that this is standard behaviour and that, if one is part of a group, these are
  the different stages that should be expected to happen and need to be worked
  through. Two extra stages of pre-group and adjourning can be added, as shown in
  the figure and described below.</p>

<img src="GroupDevelopment.PNG" alt="Stages of Group Development">

<h3>Stage 1 – Pre-group</h3>

<p>At this stage the task is usually broadly defined, the group is undefined, the
  resources are undefined and there might appear to be little that anyone can do.
  However, there is. Members can decide on commitment at this early stage, and
  show it by, for example, arriving on time, or behaving in a way that demonstrates
  their willingness to be part of the group.</p>

<h3>Stage 2 – Forming</h3>
  
<p>As the groups are formed, inclusion or exclusion is of paramount importance as
  members try to work out their place in the group. There may be superficial
  conversation and people orientate to each other and the task. It is suggested that
  even at this early stage there will be a search for direction and people will be
  looking for someone to provide strong leadership. The culture of the group is
  established during this stage. When teams are beginning, each member considers
  his or her identity within the group. Identity can be considered to be a combination
  of personality, behaviour, competencies, and position in the social structure of the
  group (Borgatti, 2002). Certain members will fight for dominance, others will like
  to be seen as being smart, others will play a comedian role, and some just want to
  be liked. Knowing Belbin’s roles helps a team through this stage by allowing the
  preferred styles of individuals to be incorporated in planning roles for the group by
  the leader.</p>

<h3>Stage 3 – Storming</h3>

  <p>Once the initial nerves are overcome, it is time for people to be confident enough
  to cause trouble! There may be the first conflict with personal agendas revealed.
  The interactions between members may be quite uneven and there is the tendency
  to rebel against the leader. The interactions allow a pecking order to be established.
  It is important to resolve conflict, otherwise apathy can set in, and doubts may
  surface about the ability to cope with the task.</p>

<h3>Stage 4 – Norming</h3>

<p>Following the early disruptions, there may emerge a sense of renewed hope.
  Members can become more tolerant of each other and cohesion increases, and
  harmony becomes important. The roles of the members are established and they
  can become less dependent on the leader, although the leader is still necessary.</p>

<h3>Stage 5 – Performing</h3>

<p>The group then enters its most productive phase. Members ‘get on with the job’,
  although minor problems may still occur. The role of the leader has changed and
  he or she is now seen as a peer and resource person. The roles have all been
  determined and there is consolidation of the status hierarchy.</p>

<h3>Stage 6 – Adjourning</h3>

<p>The final stage of the team is its disbandment. As things wind down, there is time
  to check that the goals have been achieved and to try and cope with the end of the
  group. Many will make plans for future meetings and there may even be some
  sadness. Most importantly, there will often be a level of excitement based on what
  was achieved.</p>

<p>As teams evolve, if new members join the group, there is a tendency to revert
  to an earlier stage of development. This can be seen in Figure 6.4 where a number
  of cycles are generally needed, especially if all members do not attend meetings or
  carry out the work allocated to them.</p>

<h2>TEAM MEETING SKILLS</h2>

<p>Managing the resources that are available is paramount for any engineer
  carrying out projects. The ability to facilitate meetings and to manage one’s own
  time are two skills that are part of being an efficient manager and leader.</p>

<h3>Effective Meetings</h3>

<p>To have effective meetings, it is important to set an agenda, start and finishing
  times, the location for the meeting and ensure the chairperson keeps control of the
  process and time schedule. One simple thing that helps a lot is having an agenda.
  Brainstorming sessions have their own format. Meetings should have a designated
  outcome but if the meeting is just for a one-way distribution of information, this
  can be done prior to the meeting and the agenda set for discussion. Some simple
  processes are</p>

<p><b>A Attendees assign a chairperson</b> who should encourage active participation
  to have the best possible decision-making process. Remember the meeting is for
  the benefit of all attendees. Listen to other points of view and do not be afraid to
  offer your own opinions.</p>

<p><b>G Group dynamics</b> are important to allow all members to have a say. Ensure
  quieter members contribute, as they often have excellent ideas. Be firm with
  dominators who talk all the time, not allowing others to contribute. Remember the
  goals of the meeting.</p>

<p><b>E Expected outcomes are achieved</b> by explaining the purpose of the meeting,
  exploring ideas and allowing all members to contribute to the discussion. Each
  member should feel that a contribution is expected and will be valued.</p>

  <p><b>N Note-taking for an accurate record of the meeting is essential</b>. This is a
  skill to practise and apply in meetings. The more that one does note-taking, the
  more adept one becomes at it. Rotating the position of the official recorder of the
  meeting is important for all members to get experience.</p>

  <p><b>D Designate an action against each item</b>. Decide "who is doing what" by
  what date so that everyone is clear on what is required. Create an action list.</p>

  <p><b>A Announce and advise</b> what is on the designated Action list, by circulating
  the minutes of the meeting as soon after the meeting is completed and set the next
  agenda, including time and place! The first item on any agenda should be a “status
  check,” which is where the facilitator asks each person how things are going and
  whether actions have been undertaken and, more importantly, whether there is
  anything that needs to be discussed.</p>

<h3>Handling conflict in teams</h3>

<p>Too much conflict may be a bad thing, but some is considered good because it may
  lead to more ideas being considered. The important issue in conflict is to ensure it
  is controlled and does not get out of hand. Correct decisions need to be taken if a
  wrong engineering decision will lead to a bad outcome, even if this is bad for team
  morale. This is not as easy as it sounds because there are many sources of conflict,
  many different situations in which it occurs and therefore many different ways of
  handling it. The five ways of handling conflict shown in the figure below depend on the
  behaviour and attitude of the person causing the conflict, and the managerial style
  of the person attempting to resolve it. These will now be discussed in a little more
  detail.</p>

<img src="ConflictAndResolution.PNG" alt="Conflict and Resolution">
  
<h3>Coercion</h3>
  
<p>With coercion the leader essentially imposes his or her will on the person who has
  caused the conflict. It is a power-orientated approach and is useful if quick action
  is needed, or for unpopular decisions. While it works well in these situations, it
  may cause problems later because, although quashed at the moment, the conflict
  may not be resolved and the losers may become angry because there is competition
  for their own concerns. At this point, a negotiated resolution becomes less likely.</p>

<h3>Accommodation</h3>

<p>In accommodation, an unassertive leader works with a cooperative team member.
  Both neglect their own needs to suit others (to a certain extent). It is a useful
  conflict strategy if a team needs to preserve harmony, or when one of the two
  realises he or she is wrong. It has the advantage in that it allows others to learn by
  their mistakes, and is useful in building credit for later. On the down side, because
  they have given way, the feeling of self-worth may be diminished, and winners
  may press for further domination.</p>

<h3>Avoidance</h3>

<p>Conflict from an uncooperative team member can also be handled by avoiding the
  issues altogether. Avoidance does not address the conflict directly but sidesteps
  and attempts to postpone any resolution. As a strategy, avoidance is useful when
  the issue is trivial, or the leader’s power is low. It may also be applicable when the
  potential damage is greater than the benefits of resolution, or if there is a need to
  allow people to cool off. On the other hand, it generally gives low satisfaction and
  may even increase the opponent’s frustration.</p>
  
<h3>Compromise</h3>

<p>Compromise seeks a mutually acceptable solution to the problem, or at least a
  temporary solution. It can be used where two opponents have equal power, or to
  achieve a temporary settlement in complex matters, or when goals are only
  moderately important. The main disadvantages with it are that the conflict is
  thought likely to re-emerge, and both sides may be dissatisfied with the outcome.</p>
  
<h3>Collaboration</h3>

<p>If there is time, working together using successful negotiating behaviours can bring
  an excellent result to conflict. Collaboration can be used to find a solution when
  both parties’ concerns are too important to ignore, to maximise commitment, and
  when it is important to learn from others. It can, however, take time and energy to
  work through it.</p>
