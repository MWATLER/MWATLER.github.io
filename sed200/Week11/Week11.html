<h1>Week 11 - The Project Plan</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The project plan (PP) is at the core of the planning function for the project team, and is a blueprint for the work to be performed
  as well as the proposal to the customer, if such a proposal is indeed required.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION, continued</h2>

<p>The project plan has seven essential elements:
<ol>
<li>Needs, goals, objectives, and requirements</li>
<li>Task statements, statement of work, and work breakdown structure</li>
<li>Technical approach</li>
<li>Schedule</li>
<li>Organization, staffing, and task responsibility matrix</li>
<li>Budget</li>
<li>Risk analysis</li>
</ol></p>
<p>All project plans should contain these essential elements, although it is recommended that a project plan should be as short
  and concise as possible. If the customer requires great elaboration of the preceding elements, then a “short form,” or summary
  of the project plan, should be prepared that will serve the project team on a day-to-day basis. The project plan should be used
  in at least the following ways:
<ol>
<li>To allow all project team members, including newly assigned personnel, to understand the essentials of the project</li>
<li>To provide corporate management, to whom the project reports, with an understanding of the project</li>
<li>To convey to the customer the project essentials, as perceived and formulated by the project team</li>
<li>To form the basis for a proposal to the customer, where such a proposalis called for</li>
</ol>
  Updates to the formal project plan should be considered on a quarterly basis. Changes to various portions of the plan, such as
  the schedule, should be carried out when necessary.</p>

<h2>NEEDS, GOALS, OBJECTIVES, AND REQUIREMENTS</h2>

<p>This first part of a project plan can be divided into two parts, the first consisting of needs, goals, and objectives, and the
  second constituting the requirements. Requirements are of two types, project and system, with the latter being quite
  voluminous and usually a part of the formal contract between the customer and the system developer. Statements of needs,
  goals, and objectives can be rather variable.</p>
<p>The statements of needs, goals, objectives, and requirements come from the customer and acquirer of the system to be
  developed. The outside system developer, therefore, is a recipient (rather than an original source) of these statements. For at
  least this reason, they are much condensed or simply reiterated or incorporated by reference when a Project Manager deals
  with them in a project plan.</p>

<h3>Needs</h3>

<p>The bottom line, with respect to needs, is simply that the system acquirer must make sure that a true need exists for the system
  in question. If that is not the case, the project may ultimately not be able to be sustained.
  In terms of the program plan, the statement of need can be abstracted from the needs as represented by the acquisition agent.
  It can be very short and expressed in only a few lines. This is in distinction to the needs analysis and confirmation carried out
  by the acquirer of the system.</p>

<h3>Goals and Objectives</h3>

<p>Goals and objectives are usually short declarative statements, with goals being rather broad and objectives under each goal
  being somewhat more specific, although some treat goals and objectives in reverse order. They are often established for
  programs in distinction to projects. For this reason, they may not be a firm requirement as part of a project plan.</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>Requirements, as alluded to in earlier chapters, is a dense and important subject. At the outset, we make a distinction between
  two types:
<ol>
<li>Requirements to be fulfilled by the project (project requirements)</li>
<li>Requirements of the “system” that the project addresses (system requirements)</li>
</ol>
  Project requirements refer to all the work to be performed on the project. System requirements are applicable to the “system”
  that is being addressed by the project.</p>

<h2>TASK STATEMENTS, STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW), AND WORK BREAKDOWN
  STRUCTURE (WBS)</h2>

<p>Task statements are usually part of the statement of work (SOW) provided by the customer. Thus, these are used
  interchangeably in this text. These statements are normally accepted and reiterated by the system developer in the program
  plan. Changing the customer’s SOW is not a recommended action because it may turn into a point of contention later in the
  process. Work breakdown structures (WBSs) may or may not be part of the customer’s definition of the work to be performed.
  When it is provided by the customer, it almost always should be accepted and used by the system developer.</p>

<p>The work breakdown structure (WBS) is also a formal exposition of work to be performed. The most convenient
  form of a WBS is one in which there is a one-to-one correspondence between the tasks and the WBS. In such a case, the
  WBS elements can be considered a further breakdown of the major tasks into subtasks and each WBS element is identical to a
  subtask. If a WBS has not been defined by the customer, it is a recommended procedure to have the WBS correspond directly
  to the tasks and subtasks. However, if the customer provides a WBS, it may be necessary to develop a “cross-walk” between
  the task statements and the WBS.</p>

<h2>TECHNICAL APPROACH</h2>

<p>The technical approach is a task-by-task description of how the project team intends to execute the tasks and subtasks in the
  SOW, from a technical perspective. The technical approach is usually formulated, in detail, in response to a request for
  proposal (REP) if such an REP is a precursor to the project. In such a situation, this technical approach can be abstracted and
  used in this section of the project plan.</p>
<p>The technical approach changes, of course, for each project and the domain of the project. The approach to building a
  management information system (MIS) is different from the approach to constructing a subway or transit system. However,
  some questions that might be common to all projects, with respect to the technical approach. These
  questions assist the project team in addressing a wide variety of technical issues.</p>

<h2>SCHEDULE</h2>  

<p>A schedule is an expression of the tasks and activities to be performed along a time line.
The schedule must be ultimately consistent with the customer’s delivery requirements. This applies to interim dates as well as
the final project completion date. To the extent that the schedule drawn up by the project team does not do this, it has to be
continually reworked until all customer requirements with respect to the schedule are met. If this is not possible, then the plan is
not viable and there is an impasse that must be negotiated and resolved before work can begin.</p>

<h2>ORGANIZATION, STAFFING, AND TASK RESPONSIBILITY MATRIX (TRM)</h2>

<p>The project organization can be simply the organization chart supplemented by a short
  description of key roles and responsibilities. Staffing refers to the next step of actually assigning categories of personnel to the
  various project tasks. This results in a task responsibility matrix (TRM) based on the schedule.
  We note that person-week totals by task and by category of personnel are easily derived from the assignment of
  personnel types to the tasks. As indicated previously, if a WBS is part of the project, and the relationship between the tasks
  and the WBS has been developed, then it is possible to also develop a profile of which personnel are expected to execute the
  elements of the WBS.</p>

<h2>BUDGET</h2>

<p>From previously developed information, and some additional cost data, it is then possible to formulate a budget for the
  project. An inviolate notion in project as well as corporate management is that cost and price are not the same. If it turns out that the
  project is successful, then the enterprise would receive the bid price from the customer, which then would be booked as
  company sales or revenues. The difference between project revenue and project cost is, of course, the profit that is made by
  the project. If that number is positive and equal to or greater than the bid profit, then all is well. If it is negative, then the PM
  may be in some difficulty, with a lot of explaining to do.</p>

<h2>RISK ANALYSIS</h2>

<p>In order to avoid future difficulty, the project triumvirate, as a minimum, should carry out a risk analysis, the results of which
  become part of the project plan. This analysis attempts to focus on trouble spots before the fact, developing risk-mitigation
  strategies prior to actual work on project tasks.
  In general, it can be said that there are four kinds of risk that the Project Manager would be concerned with. These are
<ol>
<li>Technical performance risk</li>
<li>Schedule risk</li>
<li>Cost risk</li>
<li>Administrative risk</li>
</ol>
  Technical performance risk (TPR) flows from items of design, development, and construction of the system that result in not
  meeting the technical requirements set forth by the customer. These might include situations where one is pushing the state of
  the art, not meeting system response times, experiencing harsh environments that degrade system performance and numerous
  others. TPR is by far the most complex area and must be examined by domain-knowledge personnel to identify what tasks
  appear to be most difficult from the perspective of system performance.</p>

<p>Schedule risk, of course, involves not meeting project milestones. If internal milestones are not met, then the PM may be able
  to get back on schedule by the deployment of additional resources and other means. Customer delivery and review dates are
  viewed as much more serious, especially the delivery of parts of the system and special reports to the customer. If penalty
  clauses for late delivery are operative, schedule risks in this regard are considered critical. Analysis of the project chart
  is usually a good place to start in assessing schedule risk. Activities and events on the critical path should be examined in
  considerable detail because this path is the controlling factor in the overall project schedule.</p>

<p>Cost risk is often experienced when not enough effort has gone into the early cost-estimation processes. “Guesses” are
  accepted as hard data and not discovered as incorrect until the situation is investigated.</p>

<p>Risk to the project may be present when the overhead and general and administrative rates in the enterprise are not stable. If these rates increase in
  the middle of the project, they will impact total cost even though the PM may be doing everything correctly. In such a case, the
  PM is somewhat “off the hook,” but may still be asked to try to make up for these cost increases. This type of risk may be
  called an administrative risk, but its effect results in a cost risk. Another type of administrative cost risk involves the failure of
  the company to hire on time for the project, or the unexpected loss of a key person to another firm halfway through the project.</p>

<p>There are often many risks to the success of the project and it behooves the project
  triumvirate to attempt to anticipate these risks and establish risk-mitigation strategies. Therefore, the risk-analysis portion of the
  project plan would consider the previous four types of risks in terms of the following questions:
<ol>
<li>What specific risks are present for this project?</li>
<li>What are the likelihoods of experiencing these risks?</li>
<li>What are the likely consequences if indeed the risks occur?</li>
<li>Based on 2 and 3, how can we prioritize the risks that have been identified?</li>
<li>What can we do to minimize the likelihood of occurrence as well as the consequences of high-priority risks?</li>
</ol>
  The answers to the last question represent the risk-mitigation strategies.</p>

<h2>THE PROPOSAL</h2>

<p>The Project Manager is often faced with the matter of writing a proposal in order to have the opportunity to be awarded the
  project contract. In such a case, it is recommended that the previous project plan be constructed, in rough form, as a precursor
  to the actual proposal-writing process. Thus, the project plan becomes a critical input to proposal preparation because it deals
  with most of the crucial issues.
  The format of the proposal is very often structured as follows:
<ol>
<li>A technical proposal</li>
<li>A cost proposal</li>
<li>A management proposal</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h2>Systems Engineering Management Plan/Systems Engineering Plan</h2>

<p>The project plan, discussed in some detail at the beginning of this chapter, is a generic document that describes the seven
  elements of an overview plan at the project level. Some attention is paid to technical matters of the project, but the systems
  engineering approach is not the main focus of the plan at the project level. One might say, however, that the Chief Systems
  Engineer (CSE) must take on the challenge of producing, with the approval of the Project Manager (PM), a technical systems
  engineering plan.</p>
