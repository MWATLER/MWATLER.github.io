<h2>Introduction to Engineering Design</h2>

<p>In  the  study  of  science  we  seek  to  develop  theories  that  explain  natural  phenomena.  
  These  scientific  principles,  which  are  self-evident  in  the  natural  
  sciences, are also employed in the engineering sciences. Engineering science subjects  such  
  as  thermodynamics,  mechanics  and  materials  science  are  generally  based  on  established  
  scientific  principles like the first and second laws of thermodynamics, Newton's  laws, and 
  atomic and molecular theories of matter  respectively.</p>
  <p>Engineering design is quite different  since theories and hypotheses cannot be developed 
  or  tested  by  laboratory  experiments.  Engineering  design  involves  much  broader  issues  
  including <u>the consideration  of people and organizations</u>. It must therefore  be regarded as a 
  technology. Technology is defined as the application of scientific knowledge to the practical aims of 
  human life or, as it is sometimes phrased, to the change and manipulation of the human environment.
  This  is particularly  so  since  <u>no  single  absolute  answer  can  be  found  for  any  
  problem</u>  which  involves  both  design  decisions  and  compromise,  since  almost  inevitably  
  design parameters are contradictory.</p> 
  <p>Having  established  that engineering  design  is  a technology  it  is necessary  to present  a  
  definition. The  dictionary definition  of design is often "to fashion  after  a plan",
  which tells us very little about the way 
  of working that we call engineering  design. Engineering design is:
    <ul>
      <li>the total activity necessary to establish  and define  solutions to 
        problems  not  solved  before,  or</li>
      <li> new  solutions  to  problems  which  have  previously  
        been  solved  in a different  way.</li>
      <li>The engineering  designer  uses intellectual  ability  to  
        apply  scientific  knowledge  and </li>
      <li>ensures  the product  satisfies  an agreed  market  need  
        and  product  design  specification whilst </li>
      <li>permitting  manufacture  by  the  optimum  
        method.</li>
      <li>The  design  activity  is  not  complete  until  the  resulting  product  is  in  use  
        providing  an acceptable level of performance  and with clearly  identified  methods of 
        disposal.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>In order to increase our understanding of design it is helpful  to extend this definition  and to 
  identify  and highlight the main characteristics of engineering  design:  
<ul>
  <li>Trans-disciplinary</li>
  <li>Highly complex</li>
  <li>Iterative.</li>
</ul>
<b>In the design and construction of a scanner, which engineering disciplines are involved?</b><br>
Answer: Software engineering, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering.</p>

<p><b>In the design and construction of a robot vacuum cleaner, which engineering displines are involved?</b><br>
Answer: Software engineering with AI, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering.</p>
</p>


<p>Most  engineering design  is  now  a  <u>trans-disciplinary team  effort</u> and  the  distinctions  
  between the  traditional disciplines,  mechanical,  electrical,  electronic,  civil and  even 
  chemical engineers  are becoming blurred. Relatively  new areas of engineering  specialization, 
  such as control and software  engineering and artificial intelligence should be added to this list.</p>

<p>Consider for example automobiles, which not so very long ago were the sole province of 
  mechanical  engineers.  Complex  engine  management  systems,  anti-lock  braking  systems,  
  active  suspension  systems, four-wheel  steering,  air bags, and  automatic  seat belt  tensioning 
  are just some of the new developments. These systems are highly complex  and require 
  input from  many different  kinds of engineers for  their optimum  design.</p>

<p>The  main  components  in  the  general  layout are:
<ol>
  <li>Front wheel  sensor</li>
  <li>Front pulse  wheel</li>  
  <li>Hydraulic  modulator</li>  
  <li>Control  unit</li>  
  <li>Rear wheel  sensor</li>  
  <li>Rear pulse wheel</li> 
  <li>Indicator  lamp</li>  
  <li>Brake tubes.</li> 
</ol>

The main components in the electrical layout are:
<ol>
  <li>Battery</li>  
  <li>Ignition  switch  </li>
  <li>Alternator</li>
  <li>Fuse </li>
  <li>Distribution  coil  </li>
  <li>Brake  switch  </li>
  <li>Speedometer </li>
  <li>Charging  lamp </li> 
  <li>Indicator  lamp  </li>
  <li>Control unit  </li>
  <li>Hydraulic  modification  </li>
  <li>Surge protection  unit  </li>
  <li>Speedometer converter unit  </li>
  <li>Sensor -  left  front  </li>
  <li>Sensor -  right  front  </li>
  <li>ABS Fuse box </li>
  <li>Sensor -  rear wheels.</li>
</ol>

<b>Where do you think sofware fits into this picture?</b><br>
Answer: sensors and control units.
</p>

<p>Although  this  
  can vary  in detail, in general  an engineering  designer  must be capable of dealing  with  the  
  following: 
<ul>
  <li>The production of practical design solutions starting from  a limited definition  of requirements taking into account many  factors.  </li>
<li>The production  of design  schemes, analysis, manufacturing  drawings  and related  documentation  within defined  timescales.  </li>
<li>The assessment of the design requirements of a particular component, system, assembly  
or installation  in consultation  with other departments. </li>
<li>The  production  of  designs  which  will  favourably influence  the  cost  and functional 
quality  of  the  product  and  improve  profitability  and/or  the  company's  reputation  with  
customers. </li>
<li>The undertaking of feasibility  studies for  future  projects.  </li>
<li>Negotiations  with  vendors  on  aspects  of  bought  out  components  and  equipment,  and  
with subcontractors  or partner firms on  interfaces.  </li>
<li>The assessment of the work of others.</li>
</ul>
The personal  characteristics, derived from  these responsibilities, which  a design  engineer  
must possess are:
<ul>
  <li>ability to identify  problems  </li>
  <li>ability to simplify  problems  </li>
  <li>creative  skills  </li>
  <li>sound technical  knowledge  </li>
  <li>sense of urgency </li>
  <li>analytical  skills  </li>
  <li>sound judgement </li>
  <li>decisiveness </li>
  <li>open  mindedness </li> 
  <li>ability to communicate </li>
  <li>negotiating  skills  </li>
  <li>supervisory  skills. </li>
</ul>
<b>Can all of the above be taught in a classroom?</b><br>
No. Social skills for the most part cannot be taught in a classroom.
</p>

<h2>The Engineering Design Process</h2>
<p>The cost of  a product, particularly  in international  markets, is only one factor  which has a 
  bearing  on  success.  Reliability,  fitness  for  purpose,  delivery,  ease  of  maintenance  and  
  many  other  factors  have  a  significant  influence  and  many  of  these  are  determined  by  
  design.  Good  design  is therefore  critical  for  success  both  in  national  and  export  markets  
  and can only be ensured by  adherence to <u>a formal  design process</u>.</p>

<p>There are several suggested  systems which vary in detail but  are  basically  similar. The  two  
  figures below reveals  an  underlying  similarity  with  the  basic  process  being  to  identify  the  problem,  generate  potential  
  solutions,  select  from  the  solutions,  refine  and  analyse  the  selected  concept,  carry  out  
  detail  design  and  produce  product  descriptions  which  will  enable  manufacture.<br><br><br>

  <b>Can you map each of the above two diagrams to that of the software product development life-cycle shown below?</b><br><br>
<img src="ProductDevelopment.png" alt="The Software Product Development Life-Cycle"><br><br>
Answer: Business case - Market, Requirements - Specifications, Design - Concept and Detail Design, Implementation - Manufacture, Release - Sell.<br><br>

  The  first  and  most  important  stage  in  the  design  process  as  outlined  in  Fig.  1.5  is  the  
  formulation of  a  <u>Product  Design  Specification (PDS)</u>. 
  Companies  must  use  a logical  and  comprehensive  approach  to design  if  they  are to  profit  
  from  their  labours.  Therefore  an  all  encompassing  problem  definition  which  is  used  to  
  audit and guide the remainder of the design process is essential.

Answer: Image recognition, visual memory of floor layout, control of movement,...</p>

<h2>The Engineering Design Interface</h2>
<p>It  is  essential  that  a  design  engineer  has  good  communication  skills. The  design process begins 
  with a  design  brief or  Product Design Specification which triggers the design department to act.
  Two  broad  types  of  communication  can  be  identified,  internal  and  external.<br><br><br>
