<h1>Week 13 - Lessons Learned</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Throughout a project's life cycle, we learn lessons and discover opportunities for improvement. 
  Documenting lessons learned helps a project team discover both strengths and weaknesses. It provides an 
opportunity for team members and/or partners to discuss successes during the project, unintended outcomes, 
and recommendations for others involved in similar future projects.</p>

<h2>Introduction, continued</h2>

<p>Use of lessons learned is a principal component of an organizational culture committed to 
  continuous improvement and adaptive management. Lessons learned mechanisms 
  communicate acquired knowledge more effectively and ensure that beneficial information is 
  factored into planning, work processes, and activities. The mechanisms or processes used to 
  collect, share, and disseminate lessons learned may vary, but in general such a process is 
  comprised of five main elements: defining the project, collecting information, verifying 
  applicability, storage, and dissemination. The below figure is a generic representation of the lessons 
  learned process.</p>

<p><b>Question: The design of microchips often rely upon a library of standard cells. These cells are typically fundamental 
  combinational logic gates such as AND gates, OR gates, etc... and are typically fundamental sequential logic gates such as 
  D flip-flops, the latch flip-flop, the JK flip-flop etc... The standard cell library might also contain circuits that are 
  unique but used in many of the company's microchips, such as a digital signal filter. Do you think it is a good idea to 
  have a standard cell library for software? What do you call such a library?</b><br>
Answer: It is a very good idea to have such a library for software. We use such libraries all the time from the C/C++ standard 
libraries. But we should also make our own libraries. The process of collecting libraries for reuse is called <b>software reuse</b>.
</p>

<h2>Basic Lessons Learned Process</h2>

<ol>
  <li><b>Define the Project</b>.
    This step is the initial step wherein the need for lessons learned is identified and the process 
    and team through which the lessons will be collected is established. It is important to establish 
    the specific need and purpose for lessons, the audience for the product, and which individuals 
    should comprise the project team.</li>
  <li><b>Collect</b>. 
    The collection process involves the capture of information through structured and unstructured 
    processes such as project critiques, written forms, and meetings. The collection of lessons may 
    come from as many sources as an organization is willing to solicit.</li>
  <li><b>Verify and Synthesize</b>.
    This process serves to verify the accuracy and applicability of lessons submitted. Domain or 
    subject matter experts may be involved in coordinating and conducting reviews.</li>
  <li><b>Store</b>.
    The storage aspect of lessons learned usually involves incorporating lessons into an electronic 
    database for future sharing and dissemination.</li>
  <li><b>Disseminate</b>.
    The final element, and the most important, is the dissemination of lessons learned, since 
lessons are of little benefit unless they are distributed and used by people who will benefit from 
them. </li>
</ol>
<p><b>Question: Who benefits the most from the lessons learned knowledge base?</b><br>
Answer: Inexperienced project managers and project leads benefit the most from this. There are many project 
management tasks that require experience, such as risk analysis. An inexperienced project manager/lead can 
benefit from the mistakes of others without having to make these same mistakes him/herself.
</p>

<h3>Deciding on a process for collecting lessons learned </h3>

<p>There are primarily two different approaches to capturing lessons learned, and each project 
  team must decide which approach, or perhaps a combination of approaches, works best for their project.

<ol>
<li><b>Integrated</b>. 
 The simplest approach is to incorporate lessons learned early, regularly, and consistently 
 through regular project reporting, or within the context of the initial management plan.
 Capturing lessons learned would be part of the regular annual or semi-annual reporting cycle 
 and may even be embedded in the initial project management plan.</li>
<li><b>Post-Facto</b>.
 The more detailed, complex approach is one which requires a thorough examination of the 
  project post-facto. This is sometimes done in projects reactively or as an afterthought when 
  project managers realize things could have been done differently. However, many organizations 
  who have invested heavily in a project over a long period of time, or who are interested in 
  replicating similar projects are willing to spend the time and money necessary to improve 
  future efficiency. While more resource-intensive, this approach offers the benefit of bringing 
  project members and partners together for an extensive look into the operations, successes, 
  and shortcomings of the project.<br><br>

</li>
<li><b>Combination.</b>
 While it is preferred to begin with the integrated approach wherein lessons learned are part of 
 the initial project plan and team members meet regularly to capture lessons learned, it is also 
 helpful to bring together key partners and stakeholders with the project team and the end of or 
 during a project. This allows for a broader analysis and may help to build a sense of 
 collaboration and communication within the partnership or group responsible for project 
  implementation. The below table outlines how this combined approach may unfold.<br><br>

<h3>Speech Synthesis on a Mobile Device</h3>
<p><b>You are running a project which integrates speech recognition into barcode scanning. 
  The context is a warehouse. Normally, the user will scan items in a warehouse, entering text whenever 
  necessary to navigate through the scanner menus. This process can be sped up if the user can free 
  his/her hands by giving verbal commands to the scanner, rather than navigating by keyboard. 
  Therefore a speech recognition unit is required.<br>
  The speech recognition unit requires shared memory to communicate with processes. Digitized audio 
  data is passed to the speech recognition unit from a microphone through shared memory and letters/words 
  are returned from the speech recognition through another part of shared memory.<br>
  Question: What are some things that could go wrong here?</b><br>
Answer: Since this is a mobile device, RAM might be limited. The speech recognition unit 
might not recognize speech correctly, especially if the user has an accent. There might not 
be enough CPU power on the mobile device for the speech synthesis unit.<br><br>
<b>In reality, neither memory nor CPU power was a problem. The shared memory allowed fast communication 
  between the speech recognition device and the processes requiring speech recognition. The problem was 
  in speech recognition itself.<br>
  Question: How to resolve this? What lessons were learned here?</b><br>
<!--Answer: <u>Resolution</u> - Perhaps it is possible to train the speech recognition device to recognize 
a certain voice. Each warehouse worker owns a scanner, therefore the speech recognition device 
on each scanner could "learn" how to understand the worker using that scanner. Noise cancellation 
hardware may be added to cancel the noise from the warehouse.<br>
<u>Lessons Learned</u> - USE PROTOTYPING before engaging in a project. Test the speech recognition 
device with a crude prototype to see if it is as effective as advertised.-->

<h3>Process Details</h3>

<p>In identifying the project team, it is important to build initial engagement from all key players 
who will be involved in advance of the project. Include the project manager, the project team, 
  and the key stakeholders in the lessons learned exercise. Select staff with specific expertise or 
knowledge of the project and other needed skills, such as communication and writing.</p>

<p>Multiple resources exist for creating questionnaires and surveys, and designing interview 
questions. Whatever method you are using, concentrate on obtaining information in four general areas: 
<ol>
<li>What went well? </li>
<li>What didn't go well or had unintended consequences? </li>
<li>If you had it all to do over again, what would you do differently? </li>
<li>What recommendations would you make to others doing similar projects? </li>
</ol>

You can include other more detailed questions in your survey or interview, such as:
<ul>
<li>Were the project goals attained? If not, what changes need to be made to meet 
  goals in the future? </li>
<li>What surprises did the team have to deal with? </li>
<li>What project circumstances were not anticipated? </li>
<li>Did you develop any useful workarounds or solutions to problems that cropped up 
  during the project? Document the details in a way that will make sense later.  </li>
<li>For any problems that went unresolved what preventative measures can you invent 
  now that can help things go more smoothly next time?  </li>
<li>Are there any new “best practices” you can derive from this project? Note anything 
  that went so well - and now seems to be so thoroughly “road tested” - that you 
  would want to repeat the positive experience next time. </li>
<li>Can you create an easily accessible repository for lessons learned and best practices 
  you have documented? This could be a database, website, or even a simple 
  document.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>Once again, look at the speech recognition project and answer the above questions.</b></p>

<h3>The Concorde Project</h3>
<p><b>Consider the Concorde project. The origins of the Concorde project date to the early 1950s, 
  when Arnold Hall, director of the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE), asked Morien Morgan to form 
  a committee to study the supersonic transport (SST) concept. The group met for the first time in 
  February 1954 and delivered their first report in April 1955.<br><br>

  At the time it was known that the drag at supersonic speeds was strongly related to the span of the wing. 
  This led to the use of short-span, thin trapezoidal wings such as those seen on the control surfaces of 
  many missiles. The team outlined a baseline configuration that resembled an enlarged Avro 730 fighter jet.<br><br>
  
  This same short span produced very little lift at low speed, which resulted in extremely long take-off runs 
  and frighteningly high landing speeds. This would have required enormous engine power to lift off from existing 
  runways.<br><br>

  The original programme cost estimate was £70 million before 1962, (£1.39 billion in 2020). The programme experienced 
  huge cost overruns and delays, with the programme eventually costing between £1.5 and £2.1 billion in 1976,
  (£9.44 billion-13.2 billion in 2020). This extreme cost was the main reason the production run was much smaller than 
  expected. The per-unit cost was impossible to recoup, so the French and British governments absorbed the development costs.<br><br>

  On 10 April 2003, Air France and British Airways simultaneously announced they would retire Concorde later that year. They 
  cited low passenger numbers following the 25 July 2000 crash, the slump in air travel following the September 11 attacks, 
  and rising maintenance costs: Airbus, the company that acquired Aerospatiale in 2000, had made a decision in 2003 to no 
  longer supply replacement parts for the aircraft. Although Concorde was technologically advanced when introduced in the 
  1970s, 30 years later, its analogue cockpit was outdated. There had been little commercial pressure to upgrade Concorde 
  due to a lack of competing aircraft, unlike other airliners of the same era such as the Boeing 747. By its retirement, 
  it was the last aircraft in the British Airways fleet that had a flight engineer; other aircraft, such as the modernised 
  747-400, had eliminated the role.<br><br>
