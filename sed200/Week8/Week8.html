<h1>Week 8 - Product Support, Sustaining Engineering</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Product support and sustaining engineering concern the continuous improvement of a product after it has been released to the 
  customer base. Defects in the software will continue to arise after product release, as well as the need to add features to 
  your product as you further understand your customers and their evolving needs.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The main part of software engineering methods, tools and technologies has developed around
  projects as the central organisational form of software development. A project organisation depends
  on clear bounds regarding scope, participants, development effort and lead-time. What happens when
  these conditions are not given? The article claims that this is the case for software product specific ecosystems.
  As software is increasingly developed, adopted and deployed in the form of customisable and
  configurable products, software engineering as a discipline needs to take on the challenge to support software
  ecosystems.</p>

<p>The analysis results in a set of common features of product development and evolution despite
  differences in size, kind of software and business models. Design is distributed and needs to be coordinated
  across heterogeneous design constituencies that, together with the software, build a product specific
  socio-technical ecosystem. The technical design has to support the deference of part of the
  development not only to 3rd-party developers but also to local designers tailoring the software in the
  use organisation. The technical interfaces that separate the work of different design constituencies are
  contested and need to be maintained permanently. Development takes place as cycles within cycles –
  overlaying development cycles with different rhythms to accommodate different evolution drivers.</p>

<p>Successful software products
  are developed and evolved over several decades. The mere
  survival implies that the organisations developing them have been
  successful in keeping the development in synch with the developments
  of the use context supporting not only 3rd party developers
  but also End User Developers.</p>

<p>According to the SWEBOK (Software Engineering Book of Knowledge) chapter on Software 
  Engineering Management, a project provides a closure for the software
  development, defining borders regarding scope, and then based
  on the scope: effort and time. Control over scope, effort (translated
  into expenses) and lead time – at first glance – seem to be in the
  interest of both the development organisation and the organisation
  in and for which the software is to be used.</p>

<p>For many contexts in which software is developed, the assumptions
  behind the project organisation for software development
  seem to hold. However, already in 1980, the experience with the
  evolution of the IBM 360 operating system let Lehman to formulate
  the laws of software evolution [42]. Based on the understanding
  that the application of software is changing the application domain
  and with it the problem that the design is based on, Lehman declared
  that all software that is used experiences pressure for
  change. He identified a reflexive feedback cycle between usage
  and the design of software that is responsible for this dynamics.</p>

<p>The research below indicates that with respect to customisable
  and end-user configurable software products challenge the
  assumptions proposed by the project organisation of software
  development further: The delivered product is rather a half product
  that has to be configured and customised to a specific context.1
  Development takes place through interlacing heterogeneous design
  and use activities distributed across different design constituencies,
  assemblies of individual and organisational actors mandating a specific
  set of design and development decisions [64]. There is no
  decided beginning of the evolution, and the goal is to keep the product
  useful and attractive to its users over a long time, rather than
  delivering it once. Continuous contact with users and customers is
  crucial. As the use contexts change, the evolution of software products
  to keep in synch with the application domain developments requires
  continuous effort. The maintenance and communication of
  design and architectural knowledge take place in an informal manner.
  The development takes place in interlaced cycles of versions,
  service packs and long-term efforts that address the improvement
  of the overall design.</p>

<h3>UIQ – developing a user interface framework for high-end mobile
  phones</h3>

<p>UIQ develops a user interface framework plus an application
  suite for high-end mobile devices that include a phone. The interface
  platform and the application suite are based on the Symbian
  operating system. UIQ also develops specific applications for their
  customers, the producers of mobile phones. These producers, e.g.,
  Motorola and Sony Ericsson, which owned UIQ, develop their
  own applications based on the UIQ platform.</p>
<p>Another group of customers are software developers that develop
  independent software using the UIQ platform based on a licensing
  scheme. The telephone companies develop several series of
  mobile phones based on the same version of the UIQ platform. Mobile
  phones are seldom updated, once they are sold. If so – e.g., by
  downloading a new version from Sony Ericsson’s home page – the
  whole technology stack is exchanged.</p>
<p>UIQ is not directly selling to users of mobile phones, and few
  phone users are aware that they are using UIQ’s software. Nonetheless,
  usability is an important quality. The interaction design
  team members therefore have built up a network of pilot users
  whom they consult for usability tests and long term usability studies.

<h3>Microsoft Dynamics – evolving an ERP system for small and
  medium sized companies</h3>

<p>The Microsoft Dynamics development organisation is part of
  the Microsoft concern developing business solutions that use
  Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems for different market
  segments. Dynamics Nav is one of these ERP systems. There are
  about 200 people involved in the development. At the time of
  the interview, a proprietary base technology was being replaced
  with a Microsoft compatible base.</p>
<p>The base software is adapted to the legislation in different countries,
  and is configured and customised to the specific organisation
  by partners, that is consultancies specialising in implementation
  and adaptation of Microsoft ERP systems. To do so, the partners
  have access to a development environment where they can adjust
  any part of the application. The term framework is used to describe
  the programming language and modelling base. Both are used to
  implement the application, the runtime system and the development
  environment. Fig. 2 shows Dynamics Nav’s ecosystem. It differs
  from a similar one published [20], as it here focuses on the
  aspects of the ecosystem that became apparent in the interviews.</p>

<h3>SIM – Water and Environment Simulation</h3>

<p>Water and Environment Simulation2 (SIM) is a Danish not
  for-profit organisation whose headquarters is situated in a university
  related science park outside of Copenhagen. It started as a spin-off of
  a hydraulics department of the Technical University of Denmark. SIM
  offers consultancy and software services related to water and
  environmental issues. The consultancy is partly based on hydraulic
  simulation software that is also sold as software products.</p>
<p>Traditionally the software has been used in consultancy projects
  resulting in a report based on simulation runs. Through a
  graphical user interface, a hydraulic system is defined. In the case
  of one-dimensional simulations, the system consists of a network
  describing the waterways along with various other parameters
  describing the system, e.g., vents and locks influencing the flow
  of the water in specific points. The system definition, along with
  temporally varying data about inflow into the system, is used as input
  data to the so-called simulation engines. The simulation engines
  are solvers of differential equations describing the physics
  of the system. The results of the system are typically time series
  of water level and discharge at various locations in the system.
  Originally, SIM’s business was centred around consultancy and
  system development based on the software products. Hydraulic
  engineers and water management experts use the software to produce
  studies evaluating the result of changes to a water system.
  This can be the river dams for energy production, the effect of
  changes to a city’s water supply or sewer system, or the stratification
  of rivers. One of the more high profile projects was the evaluation
  of the effect of the Øresund bridge and tunnel between
  Denmark and Sweden on the water exchange between the Baltic
  and the North Sea.</p>
<p>Over time, the software has been used more and more to support
  control systems for e.g., water supply and sewage systems,
  so called ‘on-line’ systems. Here the simulation runs continuously,
  partly based on real time measurements from the water system.
  Results of the simulation are not only used to monitor the water
  system but also directly or indirectly – via an operator – to control
  the water system. Here the software and a number of tools are
  used as a set of frameworks to develop a custom monitor and
  control system. This change in usage leads to a different set of
  requirements, e.g., different simulation engines might have to be 
  integrated. The company took part in a European project developing
  a standard for interfacing simulation engines.
  When new modelling elements are needed, the software is customised,
  that is, the source code is changed. The customisation is
  done by the hydraulic engineers who have basic programming
  skills. Although the software is mainly used by internal consultants,
  it is also sold as a product to both consultancies and end-user
  organisations.</p>

<h3>UIB – software distribution for local area networks</h3>

<p>In addition to developing customer specific GIS based application,
  the Umwelt Informatik Büro (Environmental Informatics Office,
  UIB) supports, maintains and evolves an open source
  product (OPSI <a href="http://www.opsi.org/" target="_blank">http://www.opsi.org/</a>)
  steering the distribution of
  software in a local area network. It is situated in Mainz, one of
  the German regional capitals. The first version of the software
  was developed for a regional environmental agency between 
  1995 and 1998. As the software was built upon other open source
products, the decision to run it as an open source product ‘was
nearly legally necessary.’ The company lives today from offering
courses and support contracts for the product and customer specific
contract development that feed into the open source line; it
also uses the product itself doing system administration for governmental
agencies; the users who are part of the open source
community share procedures handling background installations
of specific programs.</p>
<p>About 20 governmental agencies and smaller companies are
paying customers, that is, have signed a support contract and, in
some cases, sponsor development projects of different sizes. At
the time of the interview, another 40 system administrators download
the software and the user documentation and handle the
installation and use themselves. The software fills out a market
niche, as competitive off-the-shelf products are too expensive for
small companies. The German government has decided on a policy
to use open source products where possible.</p>
<p>At the time of the interview, two and a half persons work on the
maintenance and evolution of the software; two developers and
the head of development and managing director of the company
are the ones mainly responsible for major developments and support.
About four to five persons work with customer specific system
administration, often sitting directly at the customer’s site.
Three persons work with customer specific GIS applications, and
two mainly work with administration and accountancy. As the
company has an active policy to support flexible working times,
this does not necessarily mean that the company has 12 full time
employees. However, apart from the main development group,
the internal users and the open source community members are
invited to contribute to the development, and they do so from time
to time.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>The main contribution of this article is the presentation of common
  features of product development and evolution in four companies.
  Although size, kind of software and business models
  differ, the commonalities are striking:
<ul>
  <li>The software products are developed in interaction with a product
  related ecosystem where part of the design is deferred to
  other actors closer to the concrete use context. However, real
  world ecosystems do not only consist of the product developer
  providing a platform for 3rd party developers together with the
product but includes several layers of actors customising and
configuring the software product. Often the product can be
regarded as part of one or several ecosystems itself.</li>
<li>Innovation takes place across the whole ecosystem. Contact
with users and other actors is therefore important to keep the
innovative edge of the software product.</li>
<li>The technical design and architecture exists as practice of architects
and core developers rather than as explicit documentation.</li>
<li>The interfaces for configuration and customisation both separate
and bridge the different design constituencies. They are
contested and need to be maintained continuously.</li>
<li>To juggle different and sometimes conflicting development
drivers – bug fixes, new features, technical re-engineering –
the development processes consist of an overlay of different
development cycles.</li>
<li>As the companies have to balance different qualities of their
products, they struggle with finding the right organisation of
the development team. The organisation might change depending
on different emphasis in the development, which, in turn,
depends on the dynamics of the ecosystem.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The empirical material provides a rich bouquet of different
  practices highlighting their specific advantages and disadvantages.
  Much of what is reported is not supported by the software engineering
  textbooks, but makes perfect sense, considering that the
  frame of reference for product development is not a project – defined
  by a fixed scope, time and design constituency – but continuous
  innovation across the respective ecosystem. As software is
  increasingly developed, adopted and deployed in the form of customisable
  and configurable products, software engineering as a
  discipline needs to take on the challenge to support this way of
  organising software development with methods, tools and techniques.
  Our result indicates that software ecosystems challenge
  some of the very core assumptions of traditional software
  engineering.</p>
<p>The discussion highlights some of these challenges: keeping
  contact with other actors in the ecosystem, techniques to support
  multilevel development and evolution, managing an overlay of
  development cycles with different rhythms, and documentation
  and modelling support for continuous development. Projects, however,
  still exist as a way to provide temporary closure and are defined
  where they are deemed necessary.</p>
