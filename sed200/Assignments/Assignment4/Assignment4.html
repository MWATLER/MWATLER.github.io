<h1>Assignment 4 - The Construction of a Log Cabin</h1>

<p>Due - April 15, 2022</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Living in a beautiful hand crafted log cabin will make a lot of homesteaders and off-grid dreams come true. In an age of pre-fabricated 
  furniture and modular concrete homes, a log cabin provides a unique character oozing craftsmanship, rustic charm and nature. Building a log cabin 
  does not have to take huge amounts of previous experience, skill or talent, but, it will take hard work, planning, good tools and natural resources.</p>
<p>In this assignment you will write a full project plan for the construction of a log cabin. Your plan will include the business justification, requirements, 
  a scope statement, a list of deliverables and due dates, a detailed project schedule, a risk assessment, defined roles and responsibilities, 
  resource allocation, a quality assurance plan, and a communication plan.</p>
<p>Assume you have a labour force of ten, including yourself. You will have to collect all tasks required (see below in bold), arrange them in order of 
  precedence with as many parallel activities as possible, estimate the duration of the project, estimate the costs of the project, and identify as many 
  risks as you can and how you will overcome them. At the end of the assignment, you can compare the costs of your log cabin with the cost of purchasing 
  an already constructed one.</p>

<h2>Business Justification</h2>
<p>The purchase of a 1500 square-foot log cabin on half an acre of land just north of the town of Penetanguishene Ontario costs $600,000CAD 
  in total. The half-acre lot costs $250,000CAD and the log cabin $350,000CAD. Do you feel you can construct a log cabin on a similar 
  half-acre lot in that location for a fraction of that cost? Complete the project to plan to find out.</p>

<h2>Specifications/Requirements</h2>
<p>There have been no specifications or requirements given to you in this assignment. As you browse each section, be sure to prepare a list 
  of specifications and/or requirements before you star the actual planning. Be sure to include Specifications/Requirements in your project plan.</p>

<h2>Designing Your Log Cabin</h2>
<p>For designing your log cabin, you have to consider the floor plan and details, the zoning laws/building codes, land selection, and the costs of 
  a log cabin.</p>
<p>The <b>floor plan</b> requires one worker and takes 30 days. Determining the exact boundaries of your property by referencing the <b>zoning laws</b> 
will take one person one day. Refreshing your knowledge of the local <b>building codes and regulations</b> will take one person two days. <b>Selecting 
  the exact location</b> on your property where your log cabin will go will take one person two days. <b>Estimating costs</b> will take one person 
one day.</p>
<p>The <b>costs</b> of your log cabin cannot be determined in detail now, however a preliminary estimate can be made. The signigicant costs are 
<ul>
  <li>Site preparation and foundations (roughly $5,000CAD),</li>
  <li>Utilities and services (roughly $1,000CAD),</li>
  <li>Lumber - how many logs (roughly $15,000CAD),</li>
  <li>Insulation (roughly $2,000CAD),</li>
  <li>Roofing (roughly $5,000CAD),</li>
  <li>Windows and Doors (roughly $5,000CAD),</li>
  <li>Tools (roughly $15,000CAD),</li>
  <li>Labour (roughly $25CAD/hour per person).</li>
</ul>  
</p>

<h2>Picking and Preparing the Logs</h2>
<p>For picking and preparing the logs, you have to consider the best tree species, a log calculation, the felling of the trees, debarking, and drying of 
  the logs.</p>
<p><b>Choosing a tree</b> should take one person one day. Possible choices are pine trees, cedar, spruce or oak. Next you need a <b>log calculation</b> 
  to determine how many logs you need. This will take one person one day. Let's assume you will require 100 logs. This requires the <b>felling of 100 
  trees</b>!! Let's assume one person can fall 20 trees in one day, and can <b>debark and dry</b> 40 logs in one day.

<h2>Building the Foundation</h2>
<p>A log cabin foundation must carry the weight and load of a log cabin. A log cabin foundation is used to transfer the load of your cabin safely into the sub-ground. 
  A strong, durable and stable foundation should adhere to the 3-s rule;
<ul>
<li>Subsidence - prevent subsidence when soil moves away from your cabin</li>
<li>Strength - strong enough to transmit the load from your cabin</li>
<li>Settlement - prevent your cabin from sinking into the ground</li>
</ul>

Your log cabin's foundation will be decided upon and influenced by a few key factors:
<ul>
<li>The land's rock and/or soil types</li>
<li>How big your log cabin is</li>
<li>Land contours</li>
<li>Local resources (i.e. local cement providers)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Laying the foundation will occur in three steps. First one has to pick a site for the foundation. Then one has to excavate the site 
(dig a hole) for the foundation. Finally, one has to pour the cement for the foundation.</p>

<p>Picking a site will take one person 3 days of <b>land surveying</b>. <b>Excavating the site</b> will take one person ten days but it can be done with 
  ten people in one day. <b>Pouring the cement</b> for the foundation will require three people for one day (one person cannot do this job).</p>

<h2>Laying the Logs</h2>
<p>For laying the logs, you have to sill the logs, install the floor, and construct the log walls which includes the log cabin notches, the roof 
  doors and windows.</p>
<p><b>Silling the logs</b> takes one person 1 day. A sill is the horizontal piece that forms the lowest member or one of the lowest members of 
  a framework or supporting structure. <b>Installing the floor</b> will take one person one day. Log cabin floors are typically very fast and 
  easy to assemble because their construction uses a suspended lumber floor. <b>Constructing the log walls</b> should commence as if your cabin 
does not have doors, windows or openings. It should take one person ten days to put in the walls. <b>Creating doors and windows</b> is as 
simple as removing lumber in its place. It should take one person one day. As most log cabins are either square or rectangle, there should not 
be much difficulty in building a roof. <b>Roofing</b> a log cabin will take one person two days.</p>

<h2>Log Cabin Exterior and Maintenance</h2>
<p>Once you have built your log cabin, the final stage is to weatherproof it. Moisture in humid climates and dampness in cold climates can 
  very quickly cause your log home to rot if left unfinished. The most important factors are to clean, seal and stain your cabin.</p>
<p><b>Cleaning your logs</b> should take one person two days. <b>Staining your logs</b> should take one person one day. <b>Sealing 
  your cabin</b> should take one person two days.

<h2>Risk Assessment</h2>
<p>For each task for each phase of the project, identify the risks and how you will mitigate them. Be sure to assess each risk according to 
  severity and likelihood.</p>

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<p>This section is usually completed after the project is finished. Therefore there is no need to complete this section for this assignment.</p>

<h2>The Log Cabin, a Summary</h2>
<p>All nine steps can be found in the image:<br><br>

</p>
<p>Many tasks have been identified in the construction of your log cabin. As mentioned in the Introduction, assume you have a labour force of 
  ten, including yourself. You will have to collect all tasks required, arrange them in order of precedence with as many parallel activities 
  as possible (by Gantt chart or organizational network), estimate the duration of the project, estimate the costs of the project, and identify 
  as many risks as you can and how you will overcome them. At the end of the assignment, you can compare the costs of your log cabin with the 
  cost of purchasing an already constructed one. Note that although you made a preliminary estimate of costs, you now have enough information 
  to add in the labour costs to obtain the total cost of your log cabin.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>At the end of your project plan, you have to answer the following questions:</p>
<ol>
  <li>According to the estimated costs, the log cabin worth it?</li>
  <li>Considering the risks involved, how much confidence to you have in your cost and time estimates?</li>
  <li>Would you consider log cabin construction as a business? How would the mass-production of these cabins affect cost and risk?</li>
  <li>There are no specifications or requirements given in this assignment.</li>
</ol>
