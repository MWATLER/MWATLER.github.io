<h1>Assignment 4 - The Construction of a Log Cabin</h1>

<p>Due - end of week 13</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>In this lab you will write a full project plan for the construction of a log cabin. Your plan will include the business justification, requirements, 
  a scope statement, a list of deliverables and due dates, a detailed project schedule, a risk assessment, defined roles and responsibilities, 
  resource allocation, a quality assurance plan, and a communication plan.</p>
<p>Living in a beautiful hand crafted log cabin will make a lot of homesteaders and off-grid dreams come true. In an age of pre-fabricated 
  furniture and modular concrete homes, a log cabin provides a unique character oozing craftsmanship, rustic charm and nature. Building a log cabin 
  does not have to take huge amounts of previous experience, skill or talent, but, it will take hard work, planning, good tools and natural resources.</p>

<h2>Business Justification</h2>
<p>The purchase of a 1500 square-foot log cabin on half an acre of land just north of the town of Penetanguishene Ontario costs $600,000CAD 
  in total. The half-acre lot costs $250,000CAD and the log cabin $350,000CAD. Do you feel you can construct a log cabin on a similar 
  half-acre lot in that location for a fraction of that cost? Complete the project to plan to find out.</p>

<h2>Designing Your Log Cabin</h2>
<p>For designing your log cabin, you have to consider the floor plan and details, the zoning laws/building codes, land selection, and the costs of 
  a log cabin.</p>
<p>The <b>floor plan</b> requires one worker and takes 30 days. Determining the exact boundaries of your property by referencing the <b>zoning laws</b> 
will take one person one day. Refreshing your knowledge of the local <b>building codes and regulations</b> will take one person two days. <b>Selecting 
  the exact location</b> on your property where your log cabin will go will take one person two days. <b>Estimating costs</b> will take one person 
one day.</p>
<p>The <b>costs</b> of your log cabin cannot be determined in detail now, however a preliminary estimate can be made. The signigicant costs are 
<ul>
  <li>Site preparation and foundations (roughly $5,000CAD),</li>
  <li>Utilities and services (roughly $1,000CAD),</li>
  <li>Lumber - how many logs (roughly $15,000CAD),</li>
  <li>Insulation (roughly $2,000CAD),</li>
  <li>Roofing (roughly $5,000CAD),</li>
  <li>Windows and Doors (roughly $5,000CAD),</li>
  <li>Tools (roughly $15,000CAD),</li>
  <li>Labour (roughly $25CAD/hour per person).</li>
</ul>  
</p>

<h2>Picking and Preparing the Logs</h2>
<p>For picking and preparing the logs, you have to consider the best tree species, a log calculation, the felling of the trees, debarking, and drying of 
  the logs.</p>
<p><b>Choosing a tree</b> should take one person one day. Possible choices are pine trees, cedar, spruce or oak. Next you need a <b>log calculation</b> 
  to determine how many logs you need. This will take one person one day. Let's assume you will require 100 logs. This requires the <b>felling of 100 
  trees</b>!! Let's assume one person can fall 20 trees in one day, and can debark and dry 40 logs in one day.

<h2>Laying the Logs</h2>
<p>For laying the logs, you have to sill the logs, install the floor, and construct the log walls which includes the log cabin notches, the roof 
  doors and windows.</p>
