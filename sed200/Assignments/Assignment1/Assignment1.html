<h2>Background information</h2>

<h3>The Battery</h3>

<p>You have patented a new technology which can be used with a car battery. The battery can be used inside a 
  hybrid vehicle or a purely electric vehicle. The technology involves the use of solar panels to charge the 
  battery while the vehicle is in operation.</p>

<p>You have the option of creating a new battery from scratch or attaching your new technology to one of the 
  existing types of car battery. Existing battery types are:
<ul><b>Lithium Ion Battery (Li-Ion)</b>
<li>made from carbon and highly reactive lithium</li>
<li>stores high amounts of energy</li>
<li>more horsepower than a typical hybrid-battery</li>
<li>weighs less (0.5kg)</li>
<li>150,000 miles/15 year battery Lifespan</li>
<li>recyclable</li>
<li>offers a 30 minute charge transmitted</li>
<li>best choice for hybrid vehicles</li>
<li>high cost (up to $5000), but will continue to decrease</li>
<li>larger batteries may experience overheating</li>
<li>need to produce large li-ion batteries necessary to power hybrid vehicles without reverting to the internal combustion engine</li>
</ul>

<ul><b>Nickel Metal Hybrid Battery (NiMH)</b>
<li>made from hydrogen, nickel and another metal such as titanium</li>
<li>on the market longer than Li-Ion batteries</li>
<li>more affordable ($1500) than Li-Ion batteries</li>
<li>offers 4-5 miles/kWhr</li>
<li>weighs 1kg</li>
<li>easily rechargeable but store less energy than lithium ion battery packs</li>
<li>NiMH batteries are less expensive and more predictable in performance</li>
<li>Both NiMH and Li-Ion batteries are both harmful to the environment when improperly disposed of</li>
</ul>  

<ul><b>Lead Acid Battery</b>
  <li>made from lead, sulfuric acid, and water.</li>
  <li>most affordable battery ($500)</li>
  <li>the oldest auto battery</li>
  <li>least stored energy</li>
  <li>weighs 1kg</li>
  <li>recyclable</li>
  <li>attractive for environmentalists</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><u>Question</u>: which of the three above technologies do you think you should piggy-back your new technology? Why?</p>

<p>You can produce two types of batteries: and advanced enhanced battery, and a simple enhanced battery.</p>

<p>For the advanced enhanced battery, your new technology will double the price of each battery type but will also double 
  the capacity of each battery type, depending on the availability of sunlight.</p>

<p>For the simple enhanced battery, your new technology will add 50% to the price of each battery type but will also add 50% to
   the capacity of each battery type, depending on the availability of sunlight.</p>
  
<p><u>Question</u>: which of these two battery types should you piggy-back your new technology? Why?
In determining which battery to produce, you might wish to look at the Tesla models as a baseline for the 
  advanced enhanced and the simple enhanced batteries. Tesla models can be seen at 
  <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-vehicles-compared-model-s-model-x-model-3-roadster-2020-4" target="_blank">Tesla Vehicles Compared</a>.
  For instance, the Tesla Model S uses lithium-ion battery cells in 16 modules and has a range of up to 600km.</p>

<p><u>Question:</u> how much are you going to charge for your battery?
For production, you will need to purchase roughly $250,000 worth of equipment to build either type of enhanced battery.
  Since your enhanced battery (simple or advanced) will provide the cash flow, you need to determine the price for each and the profitability for each. In doing so, 
 you will have to research the cost and profitability of the lithium-ion battery, the nickel metal hybrid battery, and the lead acid battery.</p>

<h3>Financing</h3>

<p>You had received $200,000 as inheritance from relatives which have passed on. You have skillfully invested this in stocks 
  which give you 5% annual dividend and 5% annual growth. Your funds now amount to $400,000.</p>

<p>Bank loans are available to you up to $5,000,000 at 2% interest rate if they consider you a low risk customer, or 5% 
  if they consider you a medium risk customer. The bank will not give you a loan if they consider you a high risk customer.</p>

<p>Investors are interested in financing your operation. They are willing to give you $2,500,000 but they want 50% ownership of
  your product and warehouse. They are also willing to lend you $2,500,000 at 3.5% interest rate.</p>

<p>The rate of inflation is 2%.</p>

<p><u>Question</u>: at this point, do you feel you should go ahead with your plans to mass-produce the enhanced battery or 
should you simply keep your money in stocks? Why?</p>

<h3>The Warehouse</h3>

<p>You have three options for a warehouse: one by a lake, one by train tracks, or build a new one near train tracks.</p>

<ul>The <b>warehouse by the lake</b>:
<li>Can be leased for $2/square foot for five years, then the lease is negotiable.</li>
<li>Contains 10,000 square feet of empty space</li>
<li>Has access to shipping which can move produce at $1 per kilogram per kilometre.</li>
<li>Is situated 40km from a large urban center.</li>
<li>Is situated just 5km from a small town.</li>
</ul>
<ul>The <b>warehouse by the train tracks</b>:
  <li>Can be leased for $1/square foot for five years, then the lease is negotiable.</li>
  <li>Contains 10,000 square feet of empty space</li>
  <li>Has access to rail transport which can move produce at $2 per kilogram per kilometre.</li>
  <li>Is situated in a small town.</li>
  <li>The town is known for high crime.</li>
  <li>Is situated 80km from a large urban center.</li>
</ul>
<ul>A <b>new warehouse near train tracks</b>:
  <li>Can be built for $200/square foot.</li>
  <li>Can contain up to 20,000 square feet of empty space</li>
  <li>Is situated inside a forest with road service.</li>
  <li>Is situated just 5km from a small town.</li>
  <li>Has access to truck transport which can move produce at $4 per kilogram per kilometre.</li>
  <li>Has access to rail transport which is 10km away which can move produce at $2 per kilogram per kilometre.</li>
  <li>Is situated 80km from a large urban center.</li>
</ul>

<p><u>Question</u>: Which warehouse are you inclined to go with and why?</p>

<h2>Specifications</h2>

<p>In preparing the specifications for your hybrid battery warehouse and your battery, please consider the following:<br>
  <img src="PDSCriteria.png" alt="PDS Criteria"><br><br>
  See course notes from week 3 for details on each of these requirements.</p>
<p><u>Please write specifications for your warehouse</u>. The specifications for your warehouse should mostly be taken from the manufacture requirements, acceptance standards, and disposal.</p>
<p><u>Please write specifications for your battery</u>. The specifications for your hybrid battery should mostly be taken from the performance requirements and operation requirements.</p>

<h2>Conclusion - The Business Case</h2>

<p>At this point, you have much more information than when you were looking at batteries, financing and warehouse locations.
  <u>Question</u>: which warehouse is the best in the short term (1-5 years), the medium term (5-15 years), 
  and the long term (greater than 15 years)? You might wish to write a computer program to calculate your profits for 
  each term.</p>

<p>Considering your new battery, do you feel it is worthwhile going ahead with the new technology, or a known and 
  proven technology? Please justify your decision quantitatively (with numbers) and qualitatively (without numbers).</p>

<p>Please add any other comments on whether you want to go ahead with this production plan or not.</p>

<h2>Weekly Problems</h2>

<h3>Week 1 - Introduction to Engineering Design</h3>

<ol>
<li>Search <a href="https://ca.indeed.com/" target="_blank">ca.indeed.com</a>  for  engineering  positions.  
  For  job  descriptions  that  fall  outside 
  the  traditional  forms  of  civil,  electrical,  mechanical,  chemical  and 
  mining engineering, classify them as specialisations under the relevant 
  traditional field.</li>
<li>Computers  are  listed  as  one  of  the  20th  Century's most  important 
  achievements. The  famous statement: "I think there is a world market 
  for  about  five  computers"  has  been  attributed,  rightly  or  wrongly,  to 
  Thomas  J.  Watson,  who  was  Chairman  of  IBM  in  1943  (Maney, 
  2003).  Discuss  what  problems  the  Chairman  might  have  anticipated 
  computers could and could not solve.</li>
<li>What are some of the infrastructure problems in today's cities that artificial 
  intelligence may be able to assist in solving?</li>
<li>Which disruptive technologies do  you think will  become important  in 
  the renewal of the existing engineering infrastructure?</li>
<li>Consider the problem of establishing a small scientific station based in 
  Antarctica,  to  be  permanently  occupied  by  20  people.  The  base  is  to 
  have shipping access, and will receive supplies once a year in 
  December. Make  a list of  the  main components and items  of  each component 
  which will be needed to run the base successfully.</li>
<li>Develop a list of five engineering achievements that you think may be 
  on  the  list  for  the  greatest  in  the  21st  Century.  Which  branches  of 
  engineering will be responsible for these? Do these branches exist yet?</li>
