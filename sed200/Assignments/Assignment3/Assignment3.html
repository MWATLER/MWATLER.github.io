<h1>Assignment 3 - Extensions of Three Dimensional Printing and Imaging</h1>

<p>Due - end of week 10</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>You work for a company that produces three-dimensional printers. 3D printing, or additive manufacturing, 
  is the construction of a three-dimensional object from a CAD model or a digital 3D model. The term "3D printing" 
  can refer to a variety of processes in which material is deposited, joined or solidified under computer control 
  to create a three-dimensional object, with material being added together (such as plastics, liquids or powder 
  grains being fused together), typically layer by layer.</p>
<p>You have often wondered about the application of such technology (for 3D printing) towards three dimensional imaging. 
  Three-dimensional imaging currently is used extensively in the medical field, where a technique is employed that
  combines many scans (from computed tomography, MRI or ultrasonography) computationally. Such images can then be 
  manipulated by the radiographer or physician to aid diagnosis and surgical planning.</p>
<p>Is it possible that three-dimensional images could be created in the same way 3D printers create a three-dimensional 
  object from a digital model>? If so, is it possible to create three-dimensional videos? How could such technology 
  be applied to the massive world-wide consumer market? This assignment attempts to answer such questions.</p>

<h2>Weekly Problems</h2>

<h3>Week 7 - Testing and Rework</h3>
<ol>
<li>Bolts installed on a production line are tightened with automatic wrenches. They are to
  be tightened sufficiently to yield the full cross-section in order to produce the highest
  possible initial tension. The limiting condition is twisting off the bolt head during
  assembly. The bolts have a mean twisting off torque of 20 Nm with a standard
  deviation of 1 Nm. The automatic wrenches have a standard deviation of 1.5Nm.
  What mean value of torque wrench setting would result in only 1 in 500 twisting off
  during assembly?</li>
<li>A shaft tolerance has a standard deviation of 0.01 mm. The hole tolerance has a
  standard deviation of 0.016 mm. The difference between the means is 0.045 mm. If the
  entire production is accepted for assembly, determine the proportion of assemblies with
  clearance less than the allowance of 0.01 mm and the proportion of assemblies
  expected to interfere.</li>
<li>A unit has a constant failure rate of 0.3% per 1000 hours. What is its MTBF? What are
  the probabilities of the unit successfully completing missions of 10000,
  100000 and 1000000 hours?</li>
</ol>

<h3>Week 8 - Product Support, Sustaining Engineering</h3>
<ol>
  <li>The main part of software engineering methods, tools and technologies has developed around
    projects as the central organisational form of software development. A project organisation depends
    on clear bounds regarding scope, participants, development effort and lead-time. What happens when
    these conditions are not given?</li>
  <li>Developing for an unknown number of users is the main challenge of product related development 
    as compared to custom development. How do product development companies keep in contact with
    their customers and users in order to understand the evolving needs of their users? </li>
  <li>How could the innovations resulting from several use-case scenarios communicated
    to the software product development team?</li>
  <li>Compare a service patch to fix a bug to the addition of a new feature to a software product. In doing 
    so, consider design, implementation, and test and rework.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Week 9 - Teamwork</h3>
<ol>
<li>Write down two groups/teams that you have been part of in the last year and
  determine if they were really a group or a team. Is it possible to classify them
  easily or are there elements of both in some of them?</li>
<li>Use the results of the personality test (http://www.keirsey.com/) to assess the
  attributes of the people in an engineering group project that you are involved in.
  What are the advantages of doing this in a formal way?</li>
<li>Choose three of the leaders from the following list and find out what their main
  attributes of leadership were against the 10 leadership laws. The leaders are<br>
  Mohandas (Mahatma) Gandhi, Queen Victoria, Queen Elizabeth II, Donald Trump, Barack Obama, 
  Justin Trudeau, Joseph Stalin, Bill Gates, Martin Luther King, Mao Zedong, Nelson Mandela, 
  Doug Ford, Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook), Angela Merkel (former Chancellor of Germany) and 
  Jacinda Ardern (Prime Minister of New Zealand).</li>
