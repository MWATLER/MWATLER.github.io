<h1>Assignment 3 - Extensions of Three Dimensional Printing and Imaging</h1>

<p>Due - March 25, 2022</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>You work for a company that produces three-dimensional printers. 3D printing, or additive manufacturing, 
  is the construction of a three-dimensional object from a CAD model or a digital 3D model. The term "3D printing" 
  can refer to a variety of processes in which material is deposited, joined or solidified under computer control 
  to create a three-dimensional object, with material being added together (such as plastics, liquids or powder 
  grains being fused together), typically layer by layer.</p>
<p>You have often wondered about the application of such technology (for 3D printing) towards three dimensional imaging. 
  Three-dimensional imaging currently is used extensively in the medical field, where a technique is employed that
  combines many scans (from computed tomography, MRI or ultrasonography) computationally. Such images can then be 
  manipulated by the radiographer or physician to aid diagnosis and surgical planning.</p>
<p>Is it possible that three-dimensional images could be created in the same way 3D printers create a three-dimensional 
  object from a digital model? If so, is it possible to create three-dimensional videos? How could such technology 
  be applied to the massive world-wide consumer market? This assignment attempts to answer such questions.</p>

<h2>Three-Dimensional Printing</h2>
<p>There are several technologies that are used with 3D printing. There are several applications as well. These are all shown below.</p>
<p><b>Fused Deposition Modeling</b>. Fused deposition printers use a thermoplastic filament, which is heated to its melting point and then extruded, layer by layer, 
  to create a three dimensional object. Objects created with an FDM printer start out as computer-aided design (CAD) files. Before an object can be printed, its 
  CAD file must be converted to a format that a 3D printer can understand - usually .STL format. FDM printers use two kinds of materials, a modeling material, which 
  constitutes the finished object, and a support material, which acts as a scaffolding to support the object as it's being printed.</p>
<p><b>SLA - Stereolithography</b>. Stereolithography (SLA) is an industrial 3D printing process used to create concept models, cosmetic prototypes, and complex parts 
  with intricate geometries in as fast as 1 day. A wide selection of materials, extremely high feature resolutions, and quality surface finishes are possible with SLA.
  The SLA machine begins drawing the layers of the support structures, followed by the part itself, with an ultraviolet laser aimed onto the surface of a liquid thermoset 
  resin. After a layer is imaged on the resin surface, the build platform shifts down and a recoating bar moves across the platform to apply the next layer of resin. 
  The process is repeated layer by layer until the build is complete.</p>
<p><b>SLS - Selective laser sintering</b>. Selective laser sintering is an additive manufacturing (AM) technology that uses a high power laser to sinter small particles 
  of polymer powder into a solid structure based on a 3D model. The powder is dispersed in a thin layer on top of a platform inside of the build chamber. The printer 
  preheats the powder to a temperature somewhat below the melting point of the raw material, which makes it easier for the laser to raise the temperature of specific 
  regions of the powder bed as it traces the model to solidify a part. The laser scans a cross-section of the 3D model, heating the powder to just below or right at 
  the melting point of the material. This fuses the particles together mechanically to create one solid part. The unfused powder supports the part during printing 
  and eliminates the need for dedicated support structures. The platform then lowers by one layer into the build chamber, typically between 50 to 200 microns, and 
  the process repeats for each layer until parts are complete.</p>
<p><u>Question:</u> which of the above 3D printing technologies could be conceptually suitable to 3D video?</p>
<p><b>Applications - Biomedical Engineering</b>. 3D bioprinting is a process that employs 3D printing for biological processes such as combining cells or biomaterial 
  to thereby create an item that features tissue properties. Similar to non-biomedical 3D printing, it's a process wherein material, in this case, biological rather 
  than filament or resin, is deposited layer by layer comprising biolinks. These tissue-esque formations may then be used for various applications within the 
  biomedical field.  Often, a biopsy is required as a preliminary procedure. Typically a tomographic reconstruction is performed to prepare for a layer-by-layer 
  printing process. Since biological material is being used rather than resin or filament, it's necessary to multiply as well as isolate specific cells that are 
  then mixed up with substances such as oxygen and nutrients. This basically allows biomaterials to be printed. </p>
<p><b>Applications - Aerospace and Automobile Manufacturing</b>. The Aerospace and Defense (A&D) industry is a great example of utilization Additive Manufacturing 
  (AM) (commonly referred to as 3D Printing) with a clear value proposition and the ability to create parts that are stronger and lighter than parts made using 
  traditional manufacturing. Making manufacturing tools using traditional means is rather costly and time consuming, and 
  limitations on geometry translate into both less efficient manufacturing processes and more constraints on the geometry of end-use parts. Manufacturing tools 
  that are 3D printed are lighter and more ergonomic, making it easier and safer for factory workers to perform their duties. That saves time and money on the 
  factory floor. 3D printing is also applied for fast prototyping, through to a more and more widespread production of final car parts, and ending with 3D 
  manufacturing of nearly the whole cars.</p>
<p><b>Applications - Construction and Architecture</b>. 3D Printing in the construction industry means greatly reduced production time, due to the fact that 
  machines themselves are very fast, some of them are capable of manufacturing 600 to 800-square-foot (55 to 75-square-meter) home in just 24 hours. Architects 
  and other AEC (architecture, engineering and construction) professionals are increasingly using 3D printers to produce beautiful, physical, and highly-detailed 
  architectural models. The experts can now showcase their ideas and impress their clients with tangible models that take into account precise building or 
  construction site information.</p>
<p><b>Applications - Product Prototyping</b>. Rapid prototyping is one of the most common applications for 3D printing, which offers a great deal of flexibility 
  in terms of speed and material selection. 3D printing allows the manufacturing of low-to-medium performance objects at a low cost, but it's not suitable for 
  mass production. 3D printing is considered an additive manufacturing method, meaning material is added until a specific shape is formed.</p>
<p><u>Question:</u> Looking at how 3D printing has been applied, which application is closest to 3D video?</p>

<h2>Three-Dimensional Imaging</h2>
<p><b>Volumetric Imaging</b>. Volumetric imaging refers to the production of images with height, depth, and length, in contrast to the majority of images 
  produced artificially as two dimensional representations. Viewers of volumetric images are able to view them from all angles and may even be able to 
  interact with the image, depending on its characteristics. Typically, volumetric data is described by a group of 2D image slices, stacked together to 
  form a volume. </p>
<p><b>Volumetric Imaging - Ultrasound</b>. While ultrasound imaging of a part of anatomy in 2-dimensional (D) mode, volumetric 3D ultrasound imaging 
  provides multiplanar images in several orthogonal (perpendicular) planes and may provide additional anatomical information. The rendered 3D volume 
  allows an in-depth view of the anatomy from all sides (i.e., top, bottom, front, back, left, and right).</p>
<p><b>Volumetric Imaging - Computed Tomography (CT)</b>. Volumetric medical images, such as computed tomography (CT) scans, consist of a series of stacked 
  two-dimensional (2D) images, allowing for more accurate representation of the three-dimensional (3D) nature of the body's anatomical structures. 
  In recent years, there has been a steady increase in the number of volumetric medical images interpreted in diagnostic radiology. Although volumetric 
  images are typically associated with better performance, missed or incorrect diagnoses remain prevalent in radiology.</p>
<p><b>Volumetric Imaging - Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)</b>. Volumetric imaging is a 3D technique where all the MRI signals are collected from the 
  entire tissue sample and imaged as a whole entity, therefore providing a high signal to noise ratio. The acquisition of isotropic voxels or thin 
  slices with high spatial resolution allows to create multiplanar reconstructions in all planes; a compensation for the usually longer scan time. 
  One of the greatest benefits of volumetric imaging is the elimination of subjectivity. Estimates of volume have always been incorporated into 
  standard MRI reports. Referring physicians must be able to read these MRI reports and in doing so be able to visualize the anatomy of their patients.</p>
<p><b>Volumetric Imaging - Laminography</b>. Whilst x-ray micro-computed tomography (CT) machines have developed into a popular laboratory tool for 
  non-destructive 3D imaging of materials, they are not well-suited for scanning flat objects, for which there is an increasing demand. Computed 
  laminography (CL) techniques have been developed for imaging planar samples such as fossils, paintings, printed circuit boards and composite panels. 
  Laminography systems are capable of imaging specimens with large lateral dimensions or large aspect ratios, neither of which are well suited to 
  conventional scanning procedures. </p>
<p><b>Topographic Imaging</b>.  topography is an imaging technique based on Bragg diffraction. Diffraction topographic images record the intensity 
  profile of a beam of X-rays diffracted by a crystal. A topography thus represents a two-dimensional spatial intensity mapping of reflected X-rays, 
  i.e. the spatial fine structure of a Laue reflection. This intensity mapping reflects the distribution of scattering power inside the crystal; 
  topographs therefore reveal the irregularities in a non-ideal crystal lattice. X-ray diffraction topography is one variant of X-ray imaging, 
  making use of diffraction contrast rather than absorption contrast which is usually used in radiography and computed tomography (CT). XRT is 
  used for monitoring crystal quality and visualizing defects in many different crystalline materials. It has proved helpful e.g. when developing 
  new crystal growth methods, for monitoring growth and the crystal quality achieved, and for iteratively optimizing growth conditions. In many 
  cases, topography can be applied without preparing or otherwise damaging the sample; it is therefore one variant of non-destructive testing.</p>
<p><b>Triangulation</b>.  triangulation refers to the process of determining a point in 3D space given its projections onto two, or more, images. 
  In order to solve this problem it is necessary to know the parameters of the camera projection function from 3D to 2D for the cameras involved, 
  in the simplest case represented by the camera matrices. Triangulation is sometimes also referred to as reconstruction or intersection. The 
  triangulation problem is in principle trivial. Since each point in an image corresponds to a line in 3D space, all points on the line in 3D 
  are projected to the point in the image. If a pair of corresponding points in two, or more images, can be found it must be the case that they 
  are the projection of a common 3D point x. The set of lines generated by the image points must intersect at x (3D point) and the algebraic 
  formulation of the coordinates of x (3D point) can be computed in a variety of ways. In practice, however, the coordinates of image points 
  cannot be measured with arbitrary accuracy. Instead, various types of noise, such as geometric noise from lens distortion or interest point 
  detection error, lead to inaccuracies in the measured image coordinates. As a consequence, the lines generated by the corresponding image 
  points do not always intersect in 3D space. The problem, then, is to find a 3D point which optimally fits the measured image points. In the 
  literature there are multiple proposals for how to define optimality and how to find the optimal 3D point. Since they are based on different 
  optimality criteria, the various methods produce different estimates of the 3D point x when noise is involved.</p>
<p><b>Time-Of-Flight</b>. 3D time of flight (ToF) is a type of scanner-less LIDAR (light detection and ranging) that uses high power optical 
  pulses in durations of nanoseconds to capture depth information (typically over short distances) from a scene of interest. A ToF camera 
  measures distance by actively illuminating an object with a modulated light source such as a laser and a sensor that is sensitive to the 
  laser's wavelength for capturing reflected light. The sensor measures the time delay between when the light is emitted and when the 
  reflected light is received by the camera. The time delay is proportional to twice the distance between the camera and the object 
  (round-trip), therefore the distance can be estimated as depth = c*delta_time/2 where c is the speed of light.</p>
<p><u>Question</u>: How would you convert from 3D imaging to 3D video? Which of these technologies would you use?</p>

<h2>Three-Dimensional Imaging - Holograms</h2>
<p><b>Holography</b>. holography, means of creating a unique photographic image without the use of a lens. The photographic recording 
  of the image is called a hologram, which appears to be an unrecognizable pattern of stripes and whorls but which - when illuminated 
  by coherent light, as by a laser beam - organizes the light into a three-dimensional representation of the original object.</p>
<p><b>Holography - Continuous-wave laser holography</b>. In a darkened room, a beam of coherent laser light is directed onto object O 
  from source B. The beam is reflected, scattered, and diffracted by the physical features of the object and arrives on a photographic 
  plate at P. Simultaneously, part of the laser beam is split off as an incident, or reference, beam A and is reflected by mirror M 
  also onto plate P. The two beams interfere with each other; that is, their respective amplitudes of waves combine, creating on the 
  photographic plate a complex pattern of stripes and whorls called interference fringes. These fringes consist of alternate light and 
  dark areas. The light areas result when the two beams striking the plate are in step - when crest meets crest and trough meets trough 
  in the waves from the two beams; the beams are then in phase, and so reinforce each other. When the two waves are of equal amplitude 
  but opposite phase - trough meeting crest and crest meeting trough - they cancel each other and a dark area results.</p>
<p><b>Holography - Pulsed-laser holography</b>. A moving object can be made to appear to be at rest when a hologram is produced 
  with the extremely rapid and high-intensity flash of a pulsed ruby laser. The duration of such a pulse can be less than 
  1/10,000,000 of a second; and, as long as the object does not move more than 1/10 of a wavelength of light during this short 
  time interval, a usable hologram can be obtained. With the rapidly flashing light source provided by the pulsed laser, exceedingly 
  fast-moving objects can be examined. Chemical reactions often change optical properties of solutions; by means of holography, such 
  reactions can be studied.</p>
<p><b>Holography - Nonphotographic holography</b>. Holographic images are also recorded on materials other than photographic plates. 
  Most of these nonphotographic materials, however, are still in the experimental stage, and the photographic production of holograms 
  remains the only widely used process.</p>
<p><u>Question</u>: Take a look at the holographic technologies. Which do you think is most suitable for 3D video?</p>
<p><b>Holography - Applications</b>. Some current applications that use holographic technology are:
<ul>
<li>Holographic interferometry is used by researchers and industry designers to test and design many things, from tires and engines to prosthetic limbs and artificial bones and joints.</li>
<li>Supermarket and department store scanners use a holographic lens system that directs laser light onto the bar codes of the merchandise.</li>
<li>Holographic optical elements (HOE's) are used for navigation by airplane pilots.  A holographic image of the cockpit instruments appears to float in front of the windshield.  
  This allows the pilot to keep his eyes on the runway or the sky while reading the instruments.  This feature is available on some models of automobiles.</li>
<li>Medical doctors can use three-dimensional holographic CAT scans to make measurements without invasive surgery.  This technique is also used in medical education.</li>
<li>Holograms are used in advertisements and consumer packaging of products to attract potential buyers.</li>
<li>Holograms have been used on covers of magazine publications.  One of the most memorable Sports Illustrated covers was the December 23, 1992 issue featuring Michael Jordan.  
  Holograms have also been used on sports trading cards.</li>
<li>The use of holograms on credit cards and debit cards provide added security to minimize counterfeiting.</li>
<li>Holography has been used to make archival recordings of valuable and/or fragile museum artifacts.</li>
<li>Sony Electronics uses holographic technology in their digital cameras.  A holographic crystal is used to allow the camera to detect the edge of the subject and 
  differentiate between it and the background.  As a result, the camera is able to focus accurately in dark conditions.</li>
<li>Holography has been use by artists to create pulsed holographic portraits as well as other works of art.</li>
</ul> 
</p>
<p><u>Question</u>: Which of the above applications is most suitable for 3D video?</p>

<h2>Three-Dimensional Video</h2>
<p><b>Vergence Accommodation Conflict.</b> Vergence-accommodation conflict, also known as VAC, or Accommodation-vergence conflict, occurs when your brain receives 
  mismatching cues between the distance of a virtual 3D object (vergence), and the focusing distance (accommodation) required for the eyes to focus on that object. 
  This occurs while looking at stereoscopic imagery, such as watching 3D TV/cinema, as well as in all current, traditional head-mounted displays (HMDs). It can contribute 
  to focusing problems, visual fatigue, and eyestrain, while looking at stereoscopic imagery, and vision effects that linger even after ceasing looking at the imagery.
  In traditional stereoscopic technologies, the virtual image is focused at a fixed depth away from the eyes, while the depth of the virtual objects, and the amount 
  of eye convergence, varies depending upon the content (see HMD optical design).</p>
<p><b>Real Interference-based Holograms.</b> A digital hologram is created by the interference between a coherent object and reference beam, which is digitally
  recorded by a CCD camera and processed by computational methods to obtain the holographic images. The digital hologram contains not only amplitude information of the
  object, but also phase. Moreover, the ability of the CCD camera to quantify the recorded light gives rise to a number of post-processing methods that can for instance be
  used to calculate optical thickness or refractive index variations of an object provided knowledge of one or the other is available. </p>
<p><b>2.5D</b>. The 2.5D, or three-quarter, or preudo-3D, animation is a distinct type of animation that involves the combination of 2D objects in the 3D space for the 
  creation of a 3D space impression. This animation technique is traditionally applied in the video game industry to create 2D graphical projections and other objects 
  to simulate 3D. In a nutshell, 2.5D animation is thus the 2D animation in the 3D space. Other spheres of its application include title sequences, icon and GUI design, 
  and music video production. 2.5D animation can be created by means of moving 2D objects in 3D space (both physically or with the help of computer program) or through 
  a wise application of perspective and shadows to change the way 2D objects look. Shading is a popular technique of adding 3D volume to an object; this can be done by 
  casting a shadow from the object onto its background, or by creating twin objects and greying them out. With proper arrangement of objects in the 3D space, the 2D 
  objects will obtain the required depth for the 3D illusion creation. Other methods for creating the 2.5D animation include the axonometric and oblique projection, 
  billboarding, the use of skyboxes and skydomes, parallax scrolling, and scaling along the Z axis.</p>
<p><u>Question</u>: Can any of the above technologies practical for consumer use of 3D video?</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Looking at the existing technology for 3D video, as well as the technologies for 3D printing, 3D images, and 3D holograms, can these 
  be used to produce a better product for 3D video that could perhaps be mass produced? What concepts could be borrowed from each to 
  produce 3D video?</p>
<p>Decide whether it is feasible to create a product that can be mass produced to provide 3D video. If the technology does not exist today, 
  will it exist in the next five years?</p>
