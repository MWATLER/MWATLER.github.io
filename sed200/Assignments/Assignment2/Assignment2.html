<h1>Assignment 2 - Software Defined Network Traffic System</h1>

<p>Due - February 24, 2023</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The Hamilton Public Transportation department wishes to bring some intelligence to the control of traffic in its downtown area. Since there are 
  many one-way streets it should be possible to synchronize the traffic lights to facilitate traffic flow. Traffic flow is very similar to the flow 
  of packets in a computer network, therefore it should be feasible to control the flow of traffic through a software defined network.</p>
<p>This assignment is more in the form of a knowledge base (or sometimes called a Book of Knowledge, for example see 
  <a href="swebok-v3.pdf" target="_blank">The Guide to the Software Engineering Book of Knowledge</a>). You will be 
    collecting and analyzing this project from several angles, and you will group your knowledge in various 
    categories before proposing your design.</p>
<p>This is not a for-profit based project. It is a service-based project. In the end the hope is that traffic conditions 
  in downtown Hamilton will be alleviated by a well-thought out centralized traffic controller. The implications 
are that proper traffic control will not only save the travellers' time and money for fuel, but the absence of 
vehicles idling at a stop light will be better for the environment.</p>

<h2>Background information</h2>

<p>The downtown area of Hamilton consists of the following:<br><br>
<img src="HamiltonDowntown.jpg" alt="Hamilton Downtown"><br><br>
As you can see from the map there are many one-way streets in downtown Hamilton. The goal is to synchronize 
these lights by some central controller such that a driver can drive through the downtown area in one 
direction at a certain speed without ever having to stop his/her car. The timing of these lights will 
determine the speed of the traffic.</p>

<h2>Traffic Challenges</h2>
<p>One can start this problem by assuming a perfectly ideal situation. This would mean one car on one 
  road travelling in one direction. If you start with such a grid, you can determine the timing of the 
  traffic lights to ensure that no one has to face a red light. In the following 5&times;5 grid, assume the 
  lights are 500m apart (0.5km) making the grid 2km&times;2km:<br><br>
  <img src="Grid4x4.png" alt="A 4x4 Traffic Grid"><br><br>
  To approach this problem, answer the following <u>question</u>s in your submitted assignment:
<ul>
<li>Synchronize your lights so that one car travelling west to east can drive from one end of the grid 
  to the other without stopping. What is the speed of this car?</li>
<li>Now synchronize your lights so that one car can travel from north to south from the top of the grid
  to the bottom without stopping. Can the synchronization of these lights (north to south) co-exist with 
  the synchronization of the west-to-east lights?</li>
<li>Now synchronize all lights on this grid assuming there is one car on each of the five west-to-east 
  road and one car on each of the five north-to-south road. Does your method of synchonization hold up? 
  What is the speed of these cars?</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Non-Ideal Situations</h2>
<p>If the synchronization of lights depended on an ideal situation, there would probably be no need 
  for a central controller. Non-ideal situations do occur. In your assignment, answer how you would 
  deal with the following:
<ul>
  <li><b>Rush Hour</b> is the busy part of the day when towns and cities are crowded, either in the 
    morning when people are travelling to work, or in the evening when people are travelling home.</li>
  <li><b>Road Maintenance</b> is work that takes place on roads from highways to backroads to ensure 
    they remain strong, safe and efficient. Road maintenance takes many forms, from pothole repair 
    to re-applying highway surfacing, but the overarching aim is to keep road users safe, manage 
    traffic and maintain upkeep.</li>
  <li><b>Traffic Accidents</b> occur when a vehicle collides with another vehicle, pedestrian, 
    animal, road debris, or other stationary obstruction, such as a tree, pole or building. 
    Traffic collisions often result in injury, disability, death, and property damage as well 
    as financial costs to both society and the individuals involved.</li>
  <li><b>Sports Events</b> are any professional or amateur sport, athletic game, contest, event, 
    or race involving machines, persons, or animals, for which admission tickets are offered for 
    sale and that is viewed by the public. Sports events concentrate people at specific locations 
    on game day.</li>
  <li><b>Construction</b> means any physical activity on the site involved in the erection of a 
    structure, cladding, external finish, formwork, fixture, fitting of service installation and 
    the unloading of plant, machinery, materials or the like. Road construction projects have a 
    significant effect on the operational performance of the roads (say, freeways) leading to an 
    increase in congestion and delay during the construction period.</li>
</ul>  
</p>

<h2>Information Collection</h2>
<p>To assist with the corner-cases of traffic control, some sort of congestion detection mechanism 
  is required. In your assignment, please answer how the following can help with your traffic 
  controller.
<ul>
  <li><b>Checkpoint Capture Unit</b> captures information such as license plate, vehicle type, 
    vehicle color and radar-detected vehicle speed as a vehicle passes by. This data can be 
    collected and utilized for further application. A typical checkpoint capture unit is shown 
  below:<br>
<img src="CheckPointCaptureUnit.PNG" alt="Checkpoint Capture Unit">
</li>
  <li><b>Intersection Violation Capture Unit</b> captures unlawful and unsafe driving behaviors 
    such as wrong-way driving, red-light running, and illegal lane change. They help regulate 
    responsible driving, prevent traffic accidents, improve transportation efficiency, and 
    facilitate law enforcement, allowing operators in traffic control centers to alert the 
    authorities who can take action in real time to improve public safety and hold drivers 
    accountable. A typical intersection violation capture unit is shown below:<br>
  <img src="IntersectionViolationUnit.PNG" alt="Intersection Violation Unit">
</li>
  <li><b>Portable Speed Detector</b> is a device used to measure the speed of moving objects. 
    It is used in law-enforcement to measure the speed of moving vehicles as well as in sporting 
  events to measure the speed of a given object such as a puck, baseball, or tennis ball. 
  The portable speed measures the speed of the objects at which it is pointed by detecting a change in 
   frequency of the returned radar signal caused by the Doppler effect, whereby the frequency 
   of the returned signal is increased in proportion to the object's speed of approach if the 
   object is approaching, and lowered if the object is receding. A typical speed detector is 
  shown below:<br>

</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Centralized Traffic Management</h2>
<p>To assist with deriving your algorithm, you might consider the following <u>questions</u>:
<ul>
  <li><b>Software Defined Network</b> is an architecture that abstracts different, distinguishable layers 
    of a network to make networks agile and flexible. A typical representation of SDN architecture comprises 
    three layers: the application layer, the control layer and the infrastructure layer. These layers 
    communicate using northbound and southbound application programming interfaces. See the references
    on the Software Defined Network at the top of the assignment for more information. Is such a network 
    architecture applicable to traffic control? Why or why not?</li>
  <li><b>Traffic Analysis</b> is the process of intercepting and examining messages in 
    order to deduce information from patterns in communication. In general, the greater 
    the number of messages observed, or even intercepted and stored, the more can be 
    inferred from the traffic. Traffic analysis tasks may be supported by dedicated 
    computer software programs. Advanced traffic analysis techniques may include various 
    forms of social network analysis.</li>
  <li><b>Traffic Guidance</b> means the recognition of the various situations where traffic 
    control and guidance are required, and the implementation of effective procedures, 
    including traffic control, to safely control and guide traffic with minimal interruptions 
    and delays.</li>
  <li><b>Regional Traffic Algorithm</b> analyzes the connectivity among the road sections
    according to the characteristics of the regional road network, 
    and draw to seek the regional road network the shortest path algorithm between two nodes. 
  Take a look at the following research paper: 
<a href="TimingOptimizationRegionalTrafficSignals.pdf" target="_blank">Timing Optimizations for 
  Regional Traffic Signals.</a> Would you say traffic control is an area of interest for researchers?
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>The Traffic Light</h2>
<p>At the base of your traffic controller is the traffic light. Look at the links to traffic simulators
  given in the Research Material section of the assignment and add to your assignment any other 
  considerations you can think of connected with the traffic light.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>You have up until know analyzed many sides of this problem. Do you think you could prepare a 
  centralized traffic controller that would alleviate traffic problems in downtown Hamilton? Is such 
  a project worth it, or are there simply too many variables that trying to bring order would be pointless?</p>
