<h1>Assignment 2 - Software Defined Network Traffic System</h1>

<p>Due - end of week 7</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The Hamilton Public Transportation department wishes to bring some intelligence to the control of traffic in its downtown area. Since there are 
  many one-way streets it should be possible to synchronize the traffic lights to facilitate traffic flow. Traffic flow is very similar to the flow 
  of packets in a computer network, therefore it should be feasible to control the flow of traffic through a software defined network.</p>

<h2>Weekly Problems</h2>

<h3>Week 4 - The Environment and Public Welfare</h3>

<ol>
<li>Locate  three  reports  which  are  aligned  with  the  Global  Reporting  Initiative. 
  Compare  and  contrast  the  data  contained  within  them.  How  readily  does  the  data 
  enable comparisons between the different organisations?</li>
    
<li>Select  two  of  the  2015  Sustainable  Development  Goals  and  explain  how 
  progress  towards  the  targets  could  be  measured.  How  could  these  measurements 
  inform the overall assessment of progress?</li>
     
<li>A  study  is  being  carried  out  on  alternative  energy  sources  for  the  future 
  generation of electricity in your  state.  The energy sources include coal, natural gas, 
  nuclear,  solar  and  wind  energy  (and  combinations  thereof).  List  and  describe  the 
  environmental and social effects which would need to be considered when 
  comparing these alternatives.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Week 5 - The Design Process I</h3>

<ol>
<li>3.1 What are the main engineering problems to be faced in establishing a 
  permanent human settlement on the moon?</li>
   
<li>How  would  you  undertake  a  feasibility  study  for  the  problem  of  creating  a 
  lunar  base  to  house  between  10  and  25  persons  in  a  reasonably  comfortable 
  environment  for  living  and  for  undertaking  scientific  work?  List  the  steps  you 
  would  use  in  undertaking  this  feasibility  study.  Describe  each  step  in  a  short 
  paragraph and mention what you see as the key considerations. For example, if one 
  of  the  steps  is  to  obtain  background  information,  what  kind  of  information  would 
  you want to obtain?</li>
   
<li>What  are  the  main  engineering  problems  to  be  solved  in  establishing  a  small 
  permanent  Antarctic  base  for,  say,  twenty  scientists?  Describe  briefly  the  steps  to 
  be taken in the concept design for such a base. </li>
</ol>


<h3>Week 6 - The Design Process II</h3>

<ol>
<li>Consider the energy supply and distribution system of the city where you live. 
  How  would  you  undertake  a  planning  study  to  provide  adequate  energy  over  the 
  next thirty years? What background  information  would you  want to gather in 
  undertaking  this  study?  List  several  alternative  sources  of  energy  that  might  be 
  used  to  increase  supply  to  meet  demand.  What  other  energy  options  would  you 
  consider in your study?</li>
   
  <li>In  constructing  a  building  it  is  usual  to  begin  from  the  foundations  and  work 
  progressively  upwards,  floor  by  floor.  Is  this  the  only  way  to  undertake  building 
  construction?  Can  you  think  of  any  situations  where  construction  follows  another 
  sequence?  Under  what  circumstances  might  it  be  advantageous  to  develop  an 
  alternative construction sequence?</li>
   
  <li>The Government  of South Australia is considering developing  a nuclear  waste 
  storage  site  in  a  remote area  of  the  state.  Go  through  the  steps  of  problem 
  formulation for this project using the below table as a guide. Include in this process a list 
  of the background data that you would require in order to adequately formulate the 
  problem.<br><br>
