<h1>Week 10 - Project Scheduling</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>When a large engineering project is undertaken, there are many activities that
  have to be coordinated, and careful planning is needed if the project is to be
  completed on time and within budget. Scheduling techniques to assist in the
  planning of large projects, including the critical path method (CPM) and the Gantt
  Chart. The use of these techniques assists in identifying and
  scheduling activities so that the project can be completed in the minimum feasible
  time. The rescheduling of activities take into account the limitations on certain critical
  resources.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION, continued</h2>

<p>Project scheduling deals with the timing and sequencing of the many activities that
  comprise a large project. It requires a comprehensive understanding of the project
  and informs other project management and control processes. Project scheduling
  will be used at different times within a project and will become more specific as
  the project progresses. For example, a schedule developed after the detailed design
  will be more comprehensive than the schedule developed during the preliminary
  design of the same project. Scheduling entails identification of the activities
  required within the project, estimation of the duration of each activity,
  identification of the precedence relations between activities (i.e. which ones need
  to precede others) and development of an organisational network or schedule that
  represents this information accurately. Such an organisational network can be used
  to provide the following information:
  <ul>
 <li>the minimum time to complete the project if all activities run on time;</li>
 <li>the activities that are critical to ensure that the project is finished in the
  minimum time;</li>
  <li>the earliest start time and the latest finish time for each activity, if the project
  is to be finished in the minimum time; and</li>
  <li>the amount of time by which each activity can be delayed without delaying the
  project as a whole.</li>
</ul></p>

<h2>THE CRITICAL PATH METHOD</h2>

<p>CPM uses a network of arrows and nodes to represent all
  activities in a project. Two different types of notation are commonly used. These
  are called activity on node (AON) and activity on arrow (AOA). Either notation
  can be used to represent the precedence relationships between activities.</p>

<img src="ActivityNotation.PNG" alt="Two Types of Network Notation">

<p>In the AOA notation in the above figure, the arrows represent the activities and
  the nodes are used to represent the precedence of activities. The nodes are
  arbitrarily numbered, so that each activity has a unique designation in terms of its
  start and end nodes. For example, Activity A is designated 1-2, Activity B is
  designated 2-4 and so on.</p>

<p>For the AON notation, a box represents an activity. There is also a box
  for the start and finish of the project. Arrows then represent the precedence
  relationship between activities. From the information provided above, Activities A
  and C do not need any activities to be completed before they can start. Therefore,
  they can both commence at the beginning of the project as shown in the above figure.
  Activity A must be completed before Activity B can commence, so an arrow goes
  from A to B.</p>

<p>AOA notation is more commonly used in practice.
  There are four basic rules to observe when constructing AOA organisational
  networks. These are:
<ol>
<li>the network must have one starting node and one finishing node representing
  the start and finish of the project, respectively;</li>
<li>each activity is represented by a single arrow in the network;</li>
<li>before an activity can start, all activities leading to its starting node must be
  complete; and</li>
<li>there can be, at most, one arrow between any pair of nodes in the network.
  Rule 4 is required to ensure that each activity is uniquely defined by its
  starting and ending nodes. On occasions this may require the use of dummy
  activities. These are artificial activities of zero duration that are used purely to
  maintain the logic of the network. An example of the use of dummy activities is
  shown in the figure below.</li>

<h3>Application of the Critical Path Method</h3>

<p>The CPM process for project planning involves the following steps:
<ol>
<li>list all activities that form part of the project;</li>
<li>estimate the time to complete each activity (called the duration of the activity);</li>
<li>identify the precedence relationships, i.e. for each activity, which other
  activities must be completed before it can commence;</li>
<li>construct the network;</li>
<li>analyse the network to identify the earliest start time (EST) and latest finish
  time (LFT) for each activity;</li>
<li>identify the critical path(s) for the network;</li>
<li>use the EST and LFT to estimate the latest start time (LST) and earliest finish
  time (EFT) for each activity;</li>
<li>use the EST, LST, EFT, LFT and duration for each activity to estimate its total
  float, free float and interfering float.</li>
</ol></p>

<h4>Step 1: List all activities that form part of the project.</h4>

<p>The activities can be presented as a sequential list or a hierarchical list.
  A hierarchical list is referred to as a <i>Work Breakdown Structure</i> (WBS) and is used
  to group similar tasks or activities undertaken by the same contractor.</p>

<h4>Step 2: Estimate the duration of each activity.</h4>

<p>The durations estimated are based on the assumption
  that adequate equipment and human resources are available to complete the
  activities without delays. Many simplifying assumptions are made.</p>

<h4>Step 3: Identify the precedence relationships.</h4>

<p>Determine which activities depend on the completion of which activities.</p>

<h4>Step 4: Construct the network.</h4>

<p>The construction of the network is a relatively straightforward task once steps 1-3
  have been completed. However, steps 1-4 can involve several iterations as the
  process of drawing the network can facilitate thoughts about the activities involved
  and their inter-relationships and dependencies.</p>

<h4>Step 5: Analyse the network to identify the earliest start time (EST) and latest
  finish time (LFT) for each activity.</h4>

<p>The earliest start time (EST) for an activity is the earliest time that it can commence
  assuming all preceding activities and the overall project starts on time. The latest
  finish time (LFT) for an activity is the latest time that it can finish without
  increasing the minimum completion time for the overall project. 
  Typically, the EST and LFT would be documented for each node.</p>

<p>The ESTs are calculated in the following way: Begin at the first node (i.e.,
  the node that has no arrows leading into it). In this case this is Node 1. Set the EST
  at this node to be 0. For each subsequent node the EST is determined by examining
  all activities leading into the node. For each activity determine the sum of the EST
  of its start node plus its duration. Take the largest of these values to give the EST
  at the new node.</p>

<h4>Step 6: Identify the critical path(s) for the network.</h4>

<p>The critical path is the set of all activities that cannot be delayed without delaying
  the entire project. There is always at least one critical path from the first node to
  the last node. There may be more than one critical path in some cases. The
  minimum time to complete the project is given by the length of the critical path.
  This is also given by the EST and LFT at the last node.</p>

<h4>Step 7: Use the EST and LFT to estimate the latest start time (LST) and earliest
  finish time (EFT) for each activity.</h4>

<p>The latest start time (LST) for an activity is the latest time that it can start without
  increasing the minimum completion time for the overall project. The earliest finish
  time (EFT) for an activity is the earliest time it can finish if it and all preceding
  activities start at their earliest start times.</p>

<h4>Step 8: Use the EST, LST, EFT, LFT and duration for each activity to estimate its
  total float, free float and interfering float.</h4>

<p>The <i>total float</i> (TF) for an activity is the amount of time that the activity can be
  delayed from its EST without affecting the time to complete the overall project.
  The total float must be zero for all activities on the critical path. For other
  activities, it may be determined by computing the difference between the LST and
  EST. Alternatively, the TF may be determined by computing the difference
  between the LFT and the EFT for each activity.</p>

<p>The <i>free float</i> (FF) for an activity is the amount of time that the activity can
  be delayed from its EST without affecting the starting times of subsequent
  activities. Once again, the FF is zero for all activities on the critical path. For noncritical
  activities, the FF is determined by subtracting its EST and its duration from
  the EST of its ending node.</p>

<p>The <i>interfering float</i> (IF) for an activity is simply the difference between its
  TF and FF. The use of interfering float
  could delay subsequent activities, although it will not affect the time to complete
  the overall project.</p>

<h2>GANTT CHARTS</h2>

<p>A Gantt Chart is an organisational network that represents
  the timing of activities that make up a project. In a Gantt Chart all activities are
  listed down the page with each activity having a horizontal bar representing the
  planned timing of its completion.</p>

<p>The figure below is a Gantt Chart for the construction of a highway bridge.
  The shaded bars in Figure 5.7 represent the activities
  occurring over time (based on their EST), while open bars represent total floats for
  the corresponding activities. Each activity that has float can be rescheduled within
  the times represented by the open bar without delaying the overall project
  (assuming that all other activities run to schedule).</p>

<img src="BridgeConstruction.PNG" alt="Gantt Chart for a Highway Bridge">

<p>One advantage of a Gantt Chart compared to a critical path network is that
  the former shows which activities should be running at a particular time (by noting
  which shaded bars are intersected by a vertical line through the corresponding
  time). On the other hand it is not usually possible to draw the Gantt Chart without
  first analysing the relationships between activities using a critical path network in
  order to determine the EST, LFT and floats for all activities. Furthermore, it is not
  easy to depict the precedence relationship between activities in a Gantt Chart for
  complex projects. Although, in theory, vertical lines can be drawn from the end of
  preceding activities to subsequent activities, this can become very messy and hard
  to follow for real projects. Nonetheless, Gantt Charts are commonly used to track
  the progress of projects (often in combination with critical path networks).</p>

<h2>RESOURCE SCHEDULING</h2>

<p>In drawing the organisational networks to date it has been assumed that the only
  factor that constrains the start and finish of activities is the precedence
  relationships, i.e., certain activities must be completed before a particular activity
  can commence. In practice, the availability of critical resources can constrain the
  timing of activities. These critical resources may be human resources such as the
  total workforce, skilled labour in particular areas (e.g. steel riggers or electricians)
  or critical items of equipment (e.g. cranes, bulldozers, graders). Project managers
  must schedule activities taking these critical resources into account, and, in
  appropriate cases acquire additional resources by purchase, lease, rent or
  redeployment from other projects.</p>
<p>A Gantt Chart can be used to indicate the allocation of critical resources on a
  project (or set of projects). A Gantt Chart together with a critical path network can
  be used to reschedule activities so that a project can be completed within the
  resource constraints.</p>

<p>The table below shows the estimated workforce requirements for the activities that
  make up the highway bridge project. Note that Activities G, J and P involve
  allowing the concrete to cure and do not require significant worker involvement.</p>

<img src="WorkforceRequirements.PNG" alt="Workforce Requirements for the Highway Bridge">

<p>The information given in the above table has been summarised in the bottom row
  of the Gantt Chart in Figure 5.7 above to show the workforce requirements on each day of
  the project assuming that all activities start at their EST. From the bottom row in
  Figure 5.7 it can be seen that the workforce for the project (based on EST) starts at
  28 workers and builds up to a peak of 30 workers but drops to 9 workers by day 26
  and, in fact is 0 workers for some periods of the project. This is unlikely to be
  optimal. The company carrying out the construction would want to move its
  workers between projects so that all are fully employed and that no project runs
  overtime. A common approach is to attempt to “level” or smooth the resources
  required for any particular project. A trial-and-error process can be used by moving
  non-critical activities within their allowable times so as to smooth the workforce
  requirements as much as possible.</p>

<h3>Resource Smoothing</h3>

<p>In the above example, the peak workforce was limited to 20 workers. The question
  arises as to what is the minimum peak workforce requirement that does not result
  in the project being delayed. This can be determined using the above procedure
  and progressively reducing the limit on the workforce until the time to complete
  the overall project is increased. Careful examination of Figure 5.8 indicates that a
  workforce of 20 workers is required from the start of day 39 until the end of day
  41. This cannot be reduced without delaying the overall project, so 20 is the
  minimum workforce to complete the project in minimum time. Of course, if the
  available workforce is less than this (say 17 workers), the above procedure can be
  used to schedule activities so that the project finishes in the minimum possible time
  (which in this case will be more than 71 days). Then a decision will need to be
  made as to whether it is better to accept this delay in the completion of the project
  or to hire additional workers.</p>
