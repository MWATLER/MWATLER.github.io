<h1>Week 2 - The Business Case</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>An engineering project involves the transformation of limited resources into 
  valuable final products or outputs. The  engineer must be concerned not only 
  with the technical feasibility of the project but also the economic feasibility.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Economic Evaluation</h2>

<p><u>Economic evaluation</u> is aimed  at assessing whether the  value of  the final products exceeds the  value of the 
  resources used by the  project.  The values  of the  outputs when measured in 
  economic  terms  are  called  the  <u>benefits</u>  of  the  project.  Similarly  the  values  of  the 
  resources  used  in  its  construction  and  maintenance  when  measured  in  economic 
  terms are called the <u>costs</u> of the project.</p>
<p>In  the  private  sector,  <u>benefits  and costs</u>  are  measured  by  <u>cash  flows  into  and 
  out  of  the  firm</u>,  respectively.  That  is,  a  conceptual  boundary  is  drawn  around  the 
  firm and benefits and costs are represented by cash flows across this boundary.</p> 
<p>For public sector projects, benefits and costs must be considered for society as 
  a  whole.  In  this  case,  <u>benefits  and  costs</u>  are  <u>not  necessarily  associated  with  cash 
  flows</u>.  For  example,  the  benefits  of  a  public  transport  system  are  not  necessarily 
  measured by the revenue which it generates. The government may choose to run the 
  system at a loss for social  or environmental reasons. In this case the benefits to the 
  users  of  the  system  would  probably  exceed  the  revenue  generated  by  it.  If,  for 
  example, public transport were offered free of charge, few people would argue that 
  the benefits to society were zero.</p>

<h2>The Time Value of Money</h2>
<p>The  costs  and  benefits  (or  revenue)  of  an  engineering  project  usually  occur  over  a 
  long  time  period. In carrying out an economic evaluation of such a project, it must be 
  recognized that benefits  or costs incurred in ten years  cannot be directly  compared 
  with  those  incurred  in  the  current  year. Given  the  choice  between  $1000  now  and 
  $1000  in  10  years,  very  few  people  would  choose  the  latter.  In  the  first  place,  the 
  effects of inflation are such that  fewer goods  and services could be purchased with 
  the  future  sum  than  at  present.  However,  even  in  the  absence  of  inflation,  human 
  nature is such that there is a preference to consume goods now rather than later, and 
  to  postpone  costs  if  possible. Therefore, in carrying out economic evaluation, it is necessary to discount 
  future  benefits  and  costs  in  order  to  make  them  directly  comparable  with  benefits 
  and costs incurred now. This is carried out using discounting formulae derived from 
  considerations of compound interest.</p>

<h2>The Discounting Formulae</h2>
<p>In all the economic calculations that follow, there are two basic assumptions:
  <ul>
    <li>there  is  a  single rate  of interest  (the  <u>discount</u>  rate) that  applies into the 
    future for both borrowing and lending; </li>
    <li>interest is paid in a compound fashion; that is, if interest is earned, then 
    it  is  added  to  the  capital  and  taken  into  account  for  future  calculations 
    of interest.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h4>Present worth - lump sum</h4>
<p>If a sum  of  money  P  is invested for one  year at an interest rate  of i,  then  after one 
  year the value will be:<br>
  <i>F=P(1+i)</i><br><br>
  where  <i>F</i> is the future sum  and <i>P</i> the present sum. For example, $100  invested  at a 
  interest rate of 5 percent per annum (i = 0.05) for one  year  would yield $105 at the 
  end of the year. If that money is invested for a second year, then the value becomes:<br>
  <i>F=P(1+i)(1+i) = P(1+i)<sup>2</sup></i><br><br>

  After two years the initial $100 yields $110.25. After a period of <i>n</i> years it can 
  be shown that the basic formula to calculate the future worth of a sum of money can 
  be written as:<br>
  <i>F=P(1+i)<sup>n</sup></i><br><br>

  where <i>F</i> is the future sum, <i>P</i> the present sum, <i>i</i> the interest rate and <i>n</i> the number of 
  years  (or to  be  more precise,  the number  of  time  periods over which the  interest is paid).
  By  rearranging the above equation,  it  is  possible  to  see  how  much  must  be 
deposited today to yield a certain sum of money after a given period:<br>
<i>P=F &divide; (1+i)<sup>n</sup></i><br><br>
 
where <i>P</i> is the present value of a lump sum of <i>F</i>, to be paid in <i>n</i> years. 
</p>

<h4>The effect of inflation on economic evaluation</h4>
<p>Inflation is represented by a rising general level of prices. It is important to note that 
  during an inflationary period the prices of all goods and services are not necessarily 
  rising nor are all prices necessarily rising at the same rate. The effect of inflation is 
  that  a  dollar  next  year  will  buy  less  than  a  dollar  today. It is important to 
  distinguish clearly between the concepts of inflation and the 
  time  value  of  money.  Even  in  the  absence  of  inflation,  very  few  people  would  be
  prepared  to  lend  money  at  zero  interest.  As  most  people  would  prefer  to  consume 
goods and services now rather than later, there is clearly a real time value of money. 
In  times  of  inflation,  lenders  expect  a  real  rate  of  return  on  their  money  which 
exceeds the inflation rate.</p>

<h2>Evaluation Criteria</h2>

<p>Various  economic  criteria  have  been  proposed  for  use  in  comparing  engineering 
  projects. The following criteria are described briefly and compared: 
<ul>
  <li>payback period; </li>
  <li>net present value; </li>
  <li>equivalent annual worth;</li> 
  <li>benefit-cost ratio; and </li>
  <li>internal rate of return. </li>
</ul>   
</p>

<h4>Payback Period</h4>
<p>The  payback  period  is  defined  as  the  time  it  takes  for  the  project  to  generate 
  sufficient  net  benefits  to  cover  its  initial  cost  of  construction  and  implementation. </p>

<h4>Net Present Value</h4>
<p>The  net  present  value  (<i>NPV</i>)  of  a  project  is  defined  as  the  present  value  of  all 
  benefits minus the present value of all costs. It can be written as: <br>
  NVP=PVB-PVC<br><br>

  where <i>PVB</i> is the Present Value of Benefits and <i>PVC</i> is the Present Value of Costs. 
  By using the formulae for PVB and PVC we can write:<br>
  <img src="NPV.PNG" alt"Net Present Value"><br><br>
  where <i>B<sub>t</sub></i>  is the benefit in year <i>t</i>, <i>C<sub>t</sub></i>  is the cost in year <i>t</i>, 
  <i>i</i> is the discount (or interest) rate  and  <i>n</i>  is  the  life  of  the  project  (years).  The  
  calculation  of  <i>NPV</i>  therefore involves discounting all costs and benefits back to the present time 
  to allow them to be  compared  at  the  same  point  in  time.
</p>

<p>Most  economists  advocate  <i>NPV</i>  as  the  most  appropriate  criterion  for  comparing 
  projects.  It  measures  the  net  gain  to  society  (or  the  company)  of  the  proposed 
  project. It can be used in any decision-making context. 
  In the case of a go or no-go decision, the choice is independent of the criterion used. 
  However,  in  choosing  a  single  project  from  a  list  of  mutually  exclusive  projects, 
  NPV appears to favour large projects.  </p>

<h4>Benefit to Cost Ratio</h4>
<p>The  benefit-cost  ratio  (<i>B/C</i>)  is  widely  used  for  evaluating  projects  in  the  public 
  sector.  As  normally  defined,  it  is  the  present  value  of  all  benefits  divided  by  the 
  present value of all costs: <br>
  B/C = PVB &divide; PVC<br><br>
   
  where <i>PVB</i> is the Present Value of Benefits and <i>PVC</i> is the Present Value of Costs. </p>

<p>The  benefit-cost  ratio  has  been  used  extensively  in  a  number  of  countries  for 
  comparison of projects of  various sizes. It  has some  degree of appeal when used in 
  the context of allocating scarce capital funds, i.e., capital budgeting. However, there 
  is  some  ambiguity  in  its  definition  for  projects  with  high  recurrent  costs  (e.g., 
  operating,  maintenance,  and  repair  costs).  The  basic  issue  here  is  whether  the 
  present  value of recurrent costs should be treated as negative benefits and deducted 
  from the numerator of the B/C ratio, or treated as costs and added to the 
  denominator.  A  different  value  of  B/C  ratio  will  result in  each  case.</p>


<h2>A Comparison of the Evaluation Criteria</h2>
<p>There are three basic types of decisions requiring economic evaluation. They are: 
 <ol>
<li>go or no-go decisions, for example, whether or not to build a new airport; </li>
<li>the choice of a single project from a list of mutually exclusive projects, for 
  example,  the  choice  between  a  bridge  and  a  tunnel  for  crossing  a  major 
  waterway; and </li>
<li>the  choice  of  a  number  of  projects  when  the  total  funds  available  are 
  limited,  for  example,  how  to  allocate  an  annual  capital  works  budget 
  between feasible projects.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h4>Go or no-go decisions (type 1 decisions)</h4>
<p>In  deciding  whether  or  not  an  individual  project  is  justified on  economic  grounds, 
  any one of the following criteria may be applied:<br>
NVP&gt; 0 or B/C &gt; 1<br><br>
Only one of these needs to be looked at since they will all lead to the same decision.
</p>

<h4>Choice from a list of mutually exclusive options (type 2 decisions)</h4>
<p>Often  economic  decisions  are  used  to  choose  from  a  number  of  different  options 
  where  only  one  will  be  chosen.  For  example,  what  sort  of  car  to  buy,  or  which 
  laptop  computer  to  purchase.  In  each  case,  one  will  be  chosen  in  preference  to  the 
  others. </p>

  <h4>Capital budgeting problems (type 3 decisions)</h4>
<p>It  will  be  the  case  for  most  organisations  that  the  cost  of  the  full  list  of  desirable 
  projects  exceeds  the  available  funds  and  a  choice  has  to  be  made  regarding  which 
  projects will proceed in the current budget round and which will not.</p>
<p>When making a capital budgeting decision based on the use of the benefit cost ratio, the general 
  procedure is to rank the projects from best to worst in terms  of the criterion. Projects are then
  chosen from the  top  down until the budget is exhausted.</p>
