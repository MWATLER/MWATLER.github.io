<h1>Week 4 - The Environment and Public Welfare</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This  week we look at how  sustainability,  environmental  and  social  considerations 
  inform the planning and design of engineering projects. The concept of 
  sustainability  and  its  assessment  can  be used  as  a  basis  for  the  assessment  of  development  and  community 
  projects.  Community  values  are incorporated into decision making processes by placing an emphasis on  the 
  environmental  and  social  implications  of  engineering  projects.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Prior to the 1970s, engineering projects were often human-centric. Engineers focused primarily on the technical and economic 
aspects of projects, without giving much concern to the social and environmental impacts of their work. To a large extent this 
was a reflection of the priorities of society at the time, and to a lesser extent, due to an insufficient understanding of the 
interconnectedness between engineering works and natural and social systems. Engineers now recognise that they play a critical 
role in the wise use, conservation and management of resources. They also recognise that they have an obligation to ensure that 
the needs of future generations are considered. This is reflected by professional bodies through accreditation requirements for 
engineering programs, and through codes of ethics for practising engineers.</p>

<p><b>Much has been done in my lifetime to improve the environment around us. Can you list three improvement in yours?</b><br>
<!--Answer: seatbelts, emission control on cars, transition to hybrid/electric vehicles, weaning ourselves off coal power, reduction 
of polymer waste,...-->
</p>

<h2>Sustainability</h2>

<p>The  systems  approach  provides  a  simple  and  consistent  basis  for  investigating 
  sustainability  at  all  levels  of  society,  from  the  global  scale  down  to  the  individual. 
  Gilman (1992) used systems concepts to provide the following definition of 
  sustainability:</p>
   
  <p><i>The  ability  of  a  society,  ecosystem,  or  any  such  ongoing  system  to  continue 
  functioning into the indefinite future without being forced into decline 
  through  exhaustion  or  overloading  of  key  resources  on  which  the  system 
  depends.</i></p>
<p><b>Will we eventually exhaust our fossil fuels?</b><br>
  <!--Answer: eventually yes, there were a finite number of dinosaurs, but more and more is being discovered...-->
</p>

<p>Based  on  this  definition,  Foley  et  al.  (2003)  have  shown  that  to  achieve 
  sustainability it is necessary to  manage appropriately all the resources that a system 
  relies  on.  These  include  the  natural,  the  financial,  the  social  and  the  man-made 
  infrastructure resources that are important to the functioning of the system.</p>

<p>Roberts (1990)  has shown that  self-sustaining systems in nature are generally 
  <u>closed-loop</u>  systems  that  evolved  gradually  over  time.  In  the  past  when  humans 
  developed  production  systems, they have relied on  an open loop, once-through use 
  of resources,  which  results in  much waste.  To  be  sustainable, it is necessary to use 
  closed-loop systems.</p>

<img src="ClosedLoop.PNG" alt="Closed Loop Systems">

<p><b>Does nuclear power fit this picture?</b><br>
<!--Answer: Yes, it is sustainable from an economic and resource point of view, but what do we do with 
the waste?-->
</p>

<p>A conceptual model that can be used to assess the sustainability of a system or 
  of  sustainable  system  development  (Foley  et  al.,  2003)  is  shown  in the following figure.  
  It outlines the flow of resources within the system. The model identifies infrastructure 
  and other human-made resources (I) as a key element of sustainability. 
  Infrastructure  for  urban  development  includes  buildings,  and  the  water  supply 
  system, as well  as systems  for  waste,  transport and energy.  Such a  systems 
  approach  provides  a  good  platform  for  assessing  development  and  sustainability, 
  where infrastructure and resource flow are principal considerations.</p>

<img src="SystemRepresentation.PNG" alt="System Representation">

<p><b>Does solar power fit this picture?</b><br>
<!--Answer: Infinite resource, cost worthy in sunny countries (but not so in colder climates), ergonomics might be a problem, 
environmental impact is minimal (perhaps manufacturing waste, land use)-->
</p>
<p><b>Looking ahead by two generations, does anti-matter fit this picture? See the following article from July 29, 2021:<br>
<a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/07/210729183606.htm" target="_blank">Collisions of light produce matter/antimatter from pure energy</a>.</b><br>
<!--Answer: Infinite resource, but severe side effects. It's also very dangerous if handled incorrectly.-->
</p>

<p>Each subsystem within the larger development system can be modelled (e.g. a 
  single  house  within  a  city  development).  The  flow  of  resources  such  as  water, 
  energy and  finance to  and  from  the  system  can  also  be  included in a  more  holistic 
  way than in many other currently available tools.</p>

<p>Another  application  of  the  term sustainability  relates  to  <u>corporate  social 
  responsibility</u>.  This can impact engineers  and their work through  both the strategic 
  direction  and  the  investment  decisions  of  the  organisations  within  which  they  are 
  employed  or  interact.  Sustainability  has  been  adopted  in  the  business  world  to 
  connote  the  principles  of  social  and  environmental  responsibility.  Increasingly 
  business organisations have recognized that profits alone do not guarantee 
  continuity of existence for their companies and that sustainability adds to their long-
  term  business  viability.  Investors  also  see  sustainability  issues,  such  as  controlling 
  greenhouse  gases,  as  priority  concerns  to  be  addressed  by  management.</p>
  <p><b>What is the main purpose of a corporation?</b><br>
  <!--Answer: make money for its shareholders.--></p>

  <p><b>What happens if corporate social responsibility were left to corporations? Would we have any 
  responsibility? Should governments interfere?</b><br>
  <!--Answer: Businesses have to act responsibly in order to address their long-term viability. The temptation 
  is to ignore the long term. As a result, governments have to interfere with regulations.-->
</p>

<p>The  final  application  of  the  term  sustainability,  as  discussed  here,  relates  to 
  considerations of <u>natural capital</u>. Schmidheiny (1992) of the World Business 
  Council on Sustainable Development suggested that population growth and 
  economic development will eventually  be constrained  by environmental and social 
  pressures.</p>

<h2>Planning and Design for Sustainability</h2>

<p>Time is a key consideration for sustainability as systems evolve and communities develop. 
  In evaluating the sustainability of engineering systems, projects, processes and operations, 
  a key aspect to consider is the stream of resource usage. Various tools can assist in such 
  evaluations, and are dependent on the level of society to which they are being applied. 
  Examples of readily available tools available on the Internet are listed in the following table.</p>

<img src="ImprovementProcesses.PNG" alt="Improvement Processes, Tools and Metrics">


<p>In  1992,  the  first  set  of  guiding  principles  emphasizing  sustainable 
  development, Agenda 21, were agreed to at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. In 
  2000,  eight  Millennium  Development  Goals  were  declared,  and  in  2015  countries 
  adopted  17  Sustainable  Development  Goals.  These  principles  and  goals  are  not  an 
  assessment  of sustainability  in  their  own  right.  They  inform  assessments  and 
  provide direction.</p>

<img src="SustainableGoals.PNG" alt="UN Sustainable Development Goals">

<p><b>Is there a difference between quality of life and economic standard of living?</b><br>
  <!--Answer: Economics is part of the quality of life, but there are other factors. See 17 of them above.-->
</p>

<p><b>The USA has a higher average personal wealth per capita than Canada, but has a lower median personal wealth per capita than Canada. 
  How is that possible?</b><br>
  <!--Answer: The rich-poor gap is larger in the States than here.-->
</p>
  
<p>Sustainability  assessment  can 
  and should be applied to evaluating proposed and existing processes and projects at 
  all levels of governmental and project decision making. Incorporating sustainability 
  through the design  and implementation  phases  of  a  development could  involve the 
  integration  of  social  and environmental  effects of  a  longer  time  horizon  into 
  analyses  by  the  proponents  of  projects.  Sustainability  assessment  requires  defining 
  clear societal goals (e.g. the Sustainable Development Goals) which can be 
  translated into criteria, against which assessment is conducted. It is essential that the 
  assessment method is able to discern sustainable outcomes from unsustainable ones.</p>

  Is BitCoin sustainable as more people participate?</b><br>
    <!--Answer: Newer algorithms are being developed which might make it sustainable in the future. Its ecological footprint depends 
    on how electricity is generated. Electricity can be generated by: coal, hydro, natural gas, nuclear, solar, wind, 
    geothermal,...-->

<h2>Environmental Considerations</h2>

<h3>History of Environmental Concerns</h3>

<p>While it is true that the environment and sustainability have become much more of 
  a focus for concern among people since the 1970s, it would be quite wrong to think 
  that prior to that time there were no problems and concerns. In ancient Greece some 
  2500  years  ago,  Plato lamented the consequences  of excessive logging and  grazing 
  in  the  mountainous  region  of  Attica,  near  Athens.  Similar  concerns  were  raised 
  around  1000  years  ago  in  Japan  where  excessive  eroded  granite  built  up  in  Lake 
  Biwa, due to logging for the construction of a temple (Parker, 1999). </p>

<h3>The Tragedy of the Commons</h3>

<p>The tragedy of the commons has played itself out worldwide at various times and to 
  varying  degrees.  It  can  be  explained  as  follows:  when  a  group  of  herdsmen  have 
  access to a  common pasture, it is  in each individual's  best interests to increase the 
  size  of  their  herd  without  reference  to  the  overall  carrying  capacity  of  the  land. 
  However,  this  leads  to  the  destruction  of  the  common  pasture,  so  that  everyone 
  loses.  This  type  of  situation  occurs  in  many  ways,  such  as  when  an  increasing 
  population  results  in  increased  waste  disposal  into  the  commons:  rivers,  lakes, 
  oceans, and atmosphere.</p>

<p>A  major  issue  in  city  development  involves  the  concept  of  the  commons  in 
  regard  to  the  decreasing  quality  of  air  and  water  due  to  emissions  from  transport 
  systems  and  runoff  from  road  systems.  Another  issue  linked  to  the  commons  on  a 
  global  scale  is  the  consumption  of  energy  by  the  developed  nations  which  has 
  resulted  in  producing  CO2  emissions  which  have  contributed  to  global  warming. 
  Those activities  that are considered  to  be necessary  for  a high  quality  of life: food; 
  energy and transport systems; communication systems; the supply of infrastructure; 
  supply and maintenance of water and waste water systems; health systems; and the 
  management  of waste  all need  energy and  hence  generate  CO2  emissions.</p>

<h3>Energy Use</h3>

<p>Energy  use  in developing nations is  based on traditional systems of  wood and coal, 
  and not electricity. As these nations convert to electricity and develop industries that 
  use more  energy, there will be a major increase in CO2 production across the globe. 
  The growth in energy use of the developing nations is only just beginning and can be 
  expected to increase twenty fold in the next 20-30 years. The need to develop better 
  technologies  for  the  sustainability  of  cities  and  lower  CO2  emissions  are  two  goals 
  which engineers need to address if there is to be equity among nations.</p>
<p><b>Are there any countries that still use coal?</b><br>
<!--Answer: See <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coal/coal-consumption-by-country/" target="_blank">Coal Consumption by Country</a>.-->
</p>
    
<h2>Social Impact</h2>

<p>The environmental impact statement usually includes social impacts as well as effects on the 
  physical and biological components of the environment. If a full economic, environmental and 
  social evaluation of a project is carried out, it is most important to avoid the double-counting of 
  benefits or costs under more than one account. If, for example, an economic value is placed on lives 
  saved through accident reduction and this is included in the economic evaluation of the project, 
  it would not be appropriate to also highlight the number of lives saved in the social evaluation.
  The following types of social effects may need to be considered for a particular project: 
<ul>
<li>distribution of income;</li>
<li>population distribution;</li>
<li>employment;</li>
<li>life, health, and safety;</li>
<li>educational, cultural, and recreational opportunities;</li>
<li>national security and emergency preparedness;</li>
<li>displacement and relocation; and</li>
<li>neighbourhood disruption and intrusion. </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Countries with the highest income per capita are not necessarily the countries that offer the best quality of life. What are some of the 
  aspects of a high quality of life?</b><br>
<!--Answer: Beyond the essential ideas of broad access to food and housing, to quality education and health care, to employment that will 
    sustain us, quality of life may also include intangibles such as job security, political stability, mental health, individual freedom and environmental quality.
    What social scientists do agree on is that material wealth is not the most important factor in assessing a life lived well. The results of the 
    Quality of Life sub-ranking survey reflect that sensibility.
    See <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/quality-of-life-rankings" target="_blank">Quality of Life Rankings</a> (US News).-->
</p>

<h3>Distribution of Income </h3>

<p>In theory it is possible for a government to redistribute the benefits and costs of any public sector project among the various individuals or groups in society. 
This being the case, it can be argued that the role of the engineer or planner is to devise projects which maximise the total net benefits to the community and 
let the government decide how these benefits (and costs) will be distributed. However, this redistribution of benefits and costs is often not practicable because 
of the difficulties in identifying all affected groups and because of the administrative cost of carrying out the transfers. Redistribution of the benefits of 
engineering projects rarely occurs in practice.</p>

<p><b>Socialism vs Capitalism, which is better?</b><br>
  <!--Answer: Capitalism for wealth generation, socialism for converting some of that wealth into social programs for the benefit of the people.-->
</p>
  
<p>It is therefore important that the distributional consequences of any major project be explicitly considered. Of particular relevance is the effect of the 
  project on the income levels of certain target groups. These target groups may be distinguished on the basis of income (e.g. those living below the poverty 
  level), race, sex, or geographic region.</p>

<p>It has been suggested by Weisbrod (1972) that the distributional question can be approached by placing explicit weights on the benefits and costs received 
  by each group in the community. Traditional benefit-cost analysis gives the same weight to a dollar of benefits received by a pauper and by a millionaire. 
  It is conceptually possible to give a higher weight to benefits or costs incurred by low-income earners and thus develop a single index of social welfare, 
  using the following formula:</p>
 
<img src="SocialWelfare.PNG" alt="Social Welfare">

<p>where <i>SW</i> is the index of social welfare; <i>B<sub>i</sub></i> is the present value of benefits received by group <i>i</i>; <i>C<sub>i</sub></i> is the present v
  alue of costs incurred by group <i>i</i>; <i>w<sub>i</sub></i> is the “social” weight of benefits or costs to group <i>i</i>; and <i>m</i> is total number of 
  community groups. The difficulties of deciding on a set of weights and implementing this approach should be apparent. </p>

<h3>Population Distribution</h3>

<p>It has been argued that the redistribution of population throughout a region or the nation may be a major objective of government policy. 
  This is particularly true in sparsely populated nations such as Australia. Major engineering projects in remote areas may contribute positively 
  to the decentralization of population. The benefits of decentralization are related to enhanced national security and the benefits of rural versus urban living.</p>

<p><b>How did the Canadian government effect population redistribution to the western provinces in the 19th century?</b><br>
  <!--Answer: gave the land away for free.-->
</p>
    
<h3>Employment </h3>

<p>One of the benefits cited by governments when new public works are announced is the effect that it will have on unemployment. A large engineering project may involve 
considerable employment in the implementation phase and also in the operations phase. Some people consider this an achievement in itself.</p>

<h3>Life, Health, and Safety</h3> 

<p>Many engineering works contribute to saving lives, improving health, or increasing safety in the community. Typical examples are flood mitigation works, 
water treatment plants, sewage treatment, improved road alignments, grade separation, and coastal protection works.</p>

<p><b>How has software engineering improved the life, health and safety of people?</b><br>
  <!--Answer: they made computers easy to use.-->
</p>
  
<h3>Educational, Cultural, and Recreational Opportunities</h3> 

<p>It has already been stated that the distribution of income, and in particular to certain disadvantaged groups, is an important social effect. 
  Similarly the distribution of educational, cultural, and recreational opportunities among regions and socio-economic groups may be an important 
  consideration in evaluating a major project. Educational and cultural values may be enhanced by engineering projects providing improved access 
  to sites of historical, archaeological, or scientific interest.</p> 

<h2>Social Assessment Tools and Methods</h2> 

<p>An extremely important facet of undertaking any project analysis involves the participation of interested stakeholders. 
  This is an area where many engineers will be called on to manage and participate with specialists who work in the social assessment area.</p>

<p><b>In undertaking a pipeline project, which groups should be consulted with?</b><br>
  <!--Answer: geologists, those whose environment is affected,...-->
</p>
    
<h3>Analytical tools</h3>

<p><i>Stakeholder analysis</i> is an entry point to Social Impact Assessment (SIA) and participatory work. It addresses strategic questions, e.g. 
  Who are the key stakeholders? What are their interests in the project or policy? What are the power differentials between them? What relative 
  influence do they have on the operation? This information helps to identify institutions and relationships which, if ignored, can have negative 
  influence on proposals or, if considered, can be built upon to strengthen them.</p>
<p><b>In undertaking a speech-to-text conversion project, which stakeholders should be consulted with?</b><br>
  <!--Answer: the deaf, people who speak the language.-->
</p>
    
<h3>Community-based methods </h3>

<p><i>The participatory approach</i> aims to ascertain local knowledge and actions. It uses group exercises to enable stakeholders to share 
  information and to develop plans. These techniques have been employed successfully in a variety of settings to enable local people to work 
  together to plan community-appropriate developments.</p> 

<p><b>In undertaking a well-creation project for a small village in South America, which stakeholders should be consulted with?</b><br>
<!--Answer: the locals, the leaders of the village.-->
