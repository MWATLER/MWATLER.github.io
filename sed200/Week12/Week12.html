<h1>Week 12 - Risk Assessment</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Risk is inherent in all engineering work and part of the role of the engineer is to manage 
  risk levels and to keep them to the very low levels that are acceptable to society.</p>

  <h2>RISK ANALYSIS</h2>

  <p>In order to avoid future difficulty, the project triumvirate, as a minimum, should carry out a risk analysis, the results of which
    become part of the project plan. This analysis attempts to focus on trouble spots before the fact, developing risk-mitigation
    strategies prior to actual work on project tasks.
    In general, it can be said that there are four kinds of risk that the Project Manager would be concerned with. These are
  <ol>
  <li>Technical performance risk</li>
  <li>Schedule risk</li>
  <li>Cost risk</li>
  <li>Administrative risk</li>
  </ol>
    Technical performance risk (TPR) flows from items of design, development, and construction of the system that result in not
    meeting the technical requirements set forth by the customer. These might include situations where one is pushing the state of
    the art, not meeting system response times, experiencing harsh environments that degrade system performance and numerous
    others. TPR is by far the most complex area and must be examined by domain-knowledge personnel to identify what tasks
    appear to be most difficult from the perspective of system performance.</p>

  <p><b>Question: What are some typical technical performance risks for software projects?</b><br>
  Answer: Memory leaks, ghost threads, open files, unhandled exceptions, slow performance, excessive memory usage, 
    excessive power usage, minor bugs, security (including data leaks),...
  </p>
  
  <p>Schedule risk, of course, involves not meeting project milestones. If internal milestones are not met, then the PM may be able
    to get back on schedule by the deployment of additional resources and other means. Customer delivery and review dates are
    viewed as much more serious, especially the delivery of parts of the system and special reports to the customer. If penalty
    clauses for late delivery are operative, schedule risks in this regard are considered critical. Analysis of the project chart
    is usually a good place to start in assessing schedule risk. Activities and events on the critical path should be examined in
    considerable detail because this path is the controlling factor in the overall project schedule.</p>

  <p><b>Question: What is the critical path (review)?</b><br>
  Answer: The critical path is a chain of linked tasks that directly affects the project finish date. If any task on the critical 
  path is late, the whole project is late.
  </p>
  
  <p>Cost risk is often experienced when not enough effort has gone into the early cost-estimation processes.</p>

  <p><b>Question: Are cost risks and schedule risks the same for software projects?</b><br>
  Answer: Costs for software projects are almost 100% due to labour costs (the human-hours involved). So, cost and schedule risks are closely 
  related.
  </p>
  
  <p>Risk to the project may be present when the overhead and general and administrative rates in the enterprise are not stable. If these rates increase in
    the middle of the project, they will impact total cost even though the PM may be doing everything correctly. In such a case, the
    PM is somewhat "off the hook," but may still be asked to try to make up for these cost increases. This type of risk may be
    called an administrative risk, but its effect results in a cost risk. Another type of administrative cost risk involves the failure of
    the company to hire on time for the project, or the unexpected loss of a key person to another firm halfway through the project.</p>

  <p><b>Question: would you consider mass layoffs an administrative risk?</b><br>
  Answer: Yes. It does happen. You might lose a chunk of your team. You are not expected to put this in your project plan however, because 
  it would be very demoralizing to the project team. Those terminated without cause might indeed return to the company after a time.
  </p>
  
  <p>There are often many risks to the success of the project and it behooves the project
    triumvirate to attempt to anticipate these risks and establish risk-mitigation strategies. Therefore, the risk-analysis portion of the
    project plan would consider the previous four types of risks in terms of the following questions:
  <ol>
  <li>What specific risks are present for this project?</li>
  <li>What are the likelihoods of experiencing these risks?</li>
  <li>What are the likely consequences if indeed the risks occur (severity)?</li>
  <li>Based on 2 and 3, how can we prioritize the risks that have been identified?</li>
  <li>What can we do to minimize the likelihood of occurrence as well as the consequences of high-priority risks?</li>
  </ol>
    The answers to the last question represent the risk-mitigation strategies.</p>

<p><b>Question: Based on the above, how would we calculate the risk priority number?</b><br>
Answer: RPN = likelihood x severity
</p>
  
<h2>RISK ASSESSMENT</h2>

<p>Dougherty and Fragola (1988) define risk as the combination of the probability of
  an abnormal event or failure and the consequences of that event or failure to a
  project's success or a system's performance. This combination of probability (or
  likelihood) and consequences (or severity) is used in tables of risk ratings such as the below table.</p>

<img src="RiskRatings.PNG" alt="Risk Ratings">

<p>In the above table, catastrophic consequences would involve loss of life, major
  consequences include serious injury or major economic loss, moderate
  consequences include minor injuries or moderate economic loss, and minor
  consequences include minor economic loss. Efforts to minimise risk should give
  priority to the activities that have an extreme or high risk rating.</p>

<p><b>Question: What would be catastrophic to a software product?</b><br>
Answer: The software stops working and no one knows why. Data leaks of a lot of people from an 
e-banking website.
</p>

<p><b>Question: What are some ways of mitigating catastrophic risks for software?</b><br>
Answer: Embedded logging that dumps logs to a file on the system as the software is running, so you could 
see what was happening when the software crashed. These logs could also be transmitted via network to a 
central server which the software is running. A system monitor task on your software product that monitors 
all processes - if a process shuts down, the system monitor will restart it, and send a message via the 
network logging the event.<br>
For data leaks, add another layer of encryption, add another layer of authentication (2-step authentication),...<br>
Change a part of the software to "fix" the problem(s) that caused the catastrophe in the first place.
</p>

<h3>Step 1: Identify Hazards</h3>

  <p>To conduct your own risk assessment, begin by defining a scope of work. Identify 
    hazards relating to your scope. The list should be long and comprehensive and may 
    include anything.</p>
<p><b>Question: Do you consider this the most important step?</b><br>
Answer: Yes, and to do it properly requires a lot of experience.
</p>

<h3>Step 2: Calculate Likelihood</h3>

<p>For each hazard, determine the likelihood it will occur. This can be measured as a probability (a 90 per cent chance) or as a 
  frequency (twice a year). Then, based on the likelihood, choose which bracket accurately describes the probability:
<ol>
<li><b>Unlikely.</b> An unlikely hazard is extremely rare, there is a less than 10 per cent chance that it will happen.</li>
<li><b>Seldom.</b> Seldom hazards are those that happen about 10 to 35 per cent of the time.</li>
<li><b>Occasional.</b> An occasional hazard will happen between 35 and 65 per cent of the time.</li>
<li><b>Likely.</b> A likely hazard has a 65 to 90 per cent probability of occurring.</li>
<li><b>Definite.</b> These hazards will occur 90 to 100 per cent of the time. You can be nearly certain it will manifest.</li>
</ol></p>

<h3>Step 3: Calculate Consequences (Severity)</h3>

<p>In the same fashion as above, calculate potential loss using either quantitative measurements (dollar), qualitative 
  measurements (descriptive scale) or a mix of both. Then, based on the magnitude of the consequences, choose which 
  bracket accurately describes the losses:
<ol>
<li><b>Insignificant.</b> The consequences are insignificant and may cause a near negligible amount of damage. This 
  hazard poses no real threat. Examples: loss of $1K, no media coverage and/or no bodily harm.</li>
<li><b>Marginal.</b> The consequences are marginal and may cause only minor damage. This hazard is unlikely to have 
  a huge impact. Examples: loss of $10K, local media coverage and/or minor bodily harm.</li>
<li><b>Moderate.</b> The consequences are moderate and may cause a sizeable amount of damage. This hazard cannot 
  be overlooked. Examples: loss of $100K, regional media coverage and/or minor bodily harm.</li>
<li><b>Critical.</b> The consequences are critical and may cause a great deal of damage. This hazard must be addressed 
  quickly. Examples: loss of $1M, national media coverage, major bodily harm and/or police involvement.</li>
<li><b>Catastrophic.</b> The consequences are catastrophic and may cause an unbearable amount of damage. This hazard 
  is a top priority. Examples: loss of $10M+, international media coverage, extreme bodily harm and/or police involvement.</li>
</ol></p>

<h3>Step 4: Calculate Risk Rating</h3>

<p>Assign each hazard with a corresponding risk rating, based on the likelihood and impact you've already calculated. For 
  example, a hazard that is very likely to happen and will have major losses will receive a higher risk rating than a 
  hazard that's unlikely and will cause little harm. Risk ratings are based on your own opinion and divided into four brackets. 
  They are:
<ol>
<li><b>Low.</b> Low risks can be ignored or overlooked as they usually are not a significant threat. A definite hazard with 
  insignificant consequences, such as stubbing your toe, may be low risk.</li>
<li><b>Medium.</b> Medium risks require reasonable steps for prevention but they're not a priority. A likely hazard with 
  marginal consequences, such as a small fall, may be medium risk.</li>
<li><b>High.</b> High risks call for immediate action. An occasional hazard with critical consequences, such as a major 
  car accident, may be high risk.</li>
<li><b>Extreme.</b> Extreme risks may cause significant damage, will definitely occur, or a mix of both. They're a high 
  priority. An unlikely hazard with catastrophic consequences, such as an aircraft crash, is an extreme risk.</li>
</ol></p>

<h3>Step 5: Create an Action Plan</h3>

<p>Your risk action plan will outline steps to address a hazard, reduce its likelihood, reduce its impact and how to respond if it occurs.
  Depending on the severity of the hazard, you may wish to include notes about key team members (i.e., project manager, PR or 
  Communications Director, subject matter expert), preventative measures, and a response plan for media and stakeholders.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Plug the Data into a Matrix</h3>

<p>A risk assessment matrix simplifies the information from the risk assessment form, making it easier to pinpoint major 
threats in a single glance. This convenience makes it a key tool in the risk management process.
Every risk assessment matrix has two axes: one that measures the consequence impact and the other measures likelihood.
To use a risk matrix, extract the data from the risk assessment form and plug it into the matrix accordingly.</p>

<p>In the below table, <span style="color:green">green</span> is low risk, 
  <span style="color:yellow">yellow</span> is medium risk,
  <span style="color:orange">orange</span> is high risk,
  <span style="color:red">red</span> is extreme risk.</p>

<p>The following is the risk assessment form for the above risk:</p>

<img src="RiskAssessmentForm.jpeg" alt="Risk Assessment Form">

<p><b>Question: Do you prefer a visual display of risks or a tabular presentatin of risks?</b><br>
Answer: Why not both? The executives will prefer the visual display because it summarizes everything. Those 
closer to the project will prefer the tabular presentation because it can pack more detail.<br>
OR you could simply have a coloured table!
</p>
  
<h2>RISK MITIGATION</h2>

<p>Identifying risk is an important first step. It is not sufficient though.

Taking steps to deal with risk is an essential step. Knowing about and thinking about risk is not the same as doing something about risk.

Risk will occur. Some good, some bad. Some minor, some catastrophic. Your ability to mitigate risk allows you to proactively acknowledge 
and accommodate risks. Let's talk about four different strategies to mitigate risk: avoid, accept, reduce/control, or transfer.</p>

<h3>Avoidance</h3>

<p>If a risk presents an unwanted negative consequence, you may be able to completely avoid those consequences. By stepping away 
  from the business activities involved or designing out the causes of the risk you can successfully avoid the occurrence of the undesired events.</p>

<p>One way to avoid risk is to exit the business, cancel the project, close the factory, etc. This has other consequences, yet it is an option.</p>

<p>Another approach is to establish policies and procedures that assist the organization to foresee and avoid high-risk situations. By not 
  starting a project that includes a high unwanted risk successfully avoids that risk.</p>

<p>Testing or screening of products that may have a latent defect which may lead to unwanted and unacceptably high field failures is an option. 
  Screening is not 100% effective yet may reduce the risk of field failures sufficiently.</p>

<p style="color:red">Design out of a product or process the elements that permit an unwanted risk to arise. A product design change to a more robust material 
  avoids unwanted failures due to unacceptable wear of a less robust material. Implementing engineering design reviews in the product lifecycle 
  process may help identify high-risk areas of a new product or process prior to the decision to start shipping. THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT TO DO!!</p>

<p><b>Question: Let's say you are really concerned about memory management in your software product, but not with overall memory usage. How 
  might you avoid memory management risk?<br></b>
Answer: Remove all memory allocation/deallocation and use arrays instead. Use smart pointers. Use wrappers or containers to manage resources 
other than memory.
</p>

<h3>Acceptance</h3>

<p>Every product produced has a finite chance of failing in the hands of your customer. When that risk is at an acceptable level, 
  sufficiently low estimated field failure rate, then ship the product. Accept the risk.</p>

<p>When the decision to accept the risk is in part based on an estimate or prediction, there is the risk the information incorrectly 
  forecasts the future. Therefore, for high consequence related field failures, closely monitoring field performance or establishing
  early warning systems may be prudent.</p>

<p><b>Question: How might we closely monitor field performance for software?</b><br>
Answer: As mentioned before, sending logs over the network to a central server.
</p>
  
<h3>Reduction or control</h3>

<p>If it is not possible to reduce the occurrence or severity, then implementing controls is an option. Controls that either detect 
causes of unwanted events prior to the consequence occurring during use of the product, or the detection of root causes of unwanted failures that the team can then avoid.</p>

<p>Controls may focus on management or decision-making processes. Improving the ability to find design flaws or to improve the accuracy of field failure 
  rate prediction both improve the ability to make the appropriate decisions concerning risk.</p>

<p>Another method to reduce or control risk is to diversify. Thinking through the mix of products, technologies, markets, operations, and supply chains
   permit the team the ability to limit the high-risk opportunities to a manageable or acceptable level.</p>

<p>Finally, unwanted events or high field failure rates will occur. Think through both how you will detect the onset of the event and how to respond. 
  It may be wise to stop production and shipping when product failures, even one, has a major consequence (starts a home on fire, for example). Have 
  plans in place. Acting quickly and appropriately may reduce the exposure to more failures/adverse consequences.</p>

<p><b>Question: Let us say you have software that provides services for many users at a company, but you note through monitoring that over weeks it 
  slowly loses memory perhaps due to stray processes or ghost threads. How might you control this risk?</b><br>
Answer: Remote reboot of your software weekly. Perform regular backups - daily incremental, weekly full. Storing data on the cloud.
</p>

<h3>Transference</h3>

<p>This strategy is to shift the burden of the risk consequence to another party. This may include giving up some control, yet when something goes wrong your organization is not responsible.</p>

<p>This approach may not work to protect your brand image if the product is associated with your organization. Even if the power supply vendor pays for all 
  damages due to failures in their unit, the customer only knows that your product has failed and caused damage. Use this approach with caution.</p>

<p>A conventional means to transfer risk to another organization is with the purchase of insurance. This may require a careful analysis of the presenting 
risks and probabilities, yet is a viable option in some situations.</p>

<p>Contract terms with suppliers, vendors, contractors, etc may provide a means to shift risk away from your organization. For example, if a power supply 
  fails in an expensive server causing the loss of revenue for a customer, in typical situations, you might ask for and receive a replacement power supply. 
  Or, you could require the power supply vendor to cover the cost of the entire server (which the power supply caused to fail) and the loss experienced by the customer.</p>

<p><b>Question: One way of transferring risk is to out-source some of your work. What if the software provided by this third party has some bugs as well?</b><br>
<!--Question: Use whatever leverage you have to force them to escalate the situation. If you have already paid them in full, you do not have much leverage.-->
</p>

<h3>Summary of Risk Mitigation Strategies</h3>

<p>Avoid, accept, reduce/control, or transfer. For each risk you encounter, you and your organization will have to deal with it. A little forethought and 
  work enable more options than just a major product recall or bankruptcy filing.</p>

<p>Within your organization's risk management framework there should be both aware of the various strategies along with understanding the guidelines for their implementation.</p>

<p>Engineers and managers throughout the organization make decisions concerning risks every day. Providing a set of clear strategies along with guidance allows the entire 
  organization to appropriately mitigate risks on a daily basis.</p>
