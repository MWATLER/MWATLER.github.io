<h1>Week 12 - Risk Assessment</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Risk is inherent in all engineering work and part of the role of the engineer is to manage 
  risk levels and to keep them to the very low levels that are acceptable to society.</p>

  <h2>RISK ANALYSIS</h2>

  <p>In order to avoid future difficulty, the project triumvirate, as a minimum, should carry out a risk analysis, the results of which
    become part of the project plan. This analysis attempts to focus on trouble spots before the fact, developing risk-mitigation
    strategies prior to actual work on project tasks.
    In general, it can be said that there are four kinds of risk that the Project Manager would be concerned with. These are
  <ol>
  <li>Technical performance risk</li>
  <li>Schedule risk</li>
  <li>Cost risk</li>
  <li>Administrative risk</li>
  </ol>
    Technical performance risk (TPR) flows from items of design, development, and construction of the system that result in not
    meeting the technical requirements set forth by the customer. These might include situations where one is pushing the state of
    the art, not meeting system response times, experiencing harsh environments that degrade system performance and numerous
    others. TPR is by far the most complex area and must be examined by domain-knowledge personnel to identify what tasks
    appear to be most difficult from the perspective of system performance.</p>
  
  <p>Schedule risk, of course, involves not meeting project milestones. If internal milestones are not met, then the PM may be able
    to get back on schedule by the deployment of additional resources and other means. Customer delivery and review dates are
    viewed as much more serious, especially the delivery of parts of the system and special reports to the customer. If penalty
    clauses for late delivery are operative, schedule risks in this regard are considered critical. Analysis of the project chart
    is usually a good place to start in assessing schedule risk. Activities and events on the critical path should be examined in
    considerable detail because this path is the controlling factor in the overall project schedule.</p>
  
  <p>Cost risk is often experienced when not enough effort has gone into the early cost-estimation processes. “Guesses” are
    accepted as hard data and not discovered as incorrect until the situation is investigated.</p>
  
  <p>Risk to the project may be present when the overhead and general and administrative rates in the enterprise are not stable. If these rates increase in
    the middle of the project, they will impact total cost even though the PM may be doing everything correctly. In such a case, the
    PM is somewhat “off the hook,” but may still be asked to try to make up for these cost increases. This type of risk may be
    called an administrative risk, but its effect results in a cost risk. Another type of administrative cost risk involves the failure of
    the company to hire on time for the project, or the unexpected loss of a key person to another firm halfway through the project.</p>
  
  <p>There are often many risks to the success of the project and it behooves the project
    triumvirate to attempt to anticipate these risks and establish risk-mitigation strategies. Therefore, the risk-analysis portion of the
    project plan would consider the previous four types of risks in terms of the following questions:
  <ol>
  <li>What specific risks are present for this project?</li>
  <li>What are the likelihoods of experiencing these risks?</li>
  <li>What are the likely consequences if indeed the risks occur?</li>
  <li>Based on 2 and 3, how can we prioritize the risks that have been identified?</li>
  <li>What can we do to minimize the likelihood of occurrence as well as the consequences of high-priority risks?</li>
  </ol>
    The answers to the last question represent the risk-mitigation strategies.</p>
  
<h2>RISK ASSESSMENT</h2>

<p>Dougherty and Fragola (1988) define risk as the combination of the probability of
  an abnormal event or failure and the consequences of that event or failure to a
  project’s success or a system’s performance. This combination of probability (or
  likelihood) and consequences is used in tables of risk ratings such as the below table.</p>

<p>In the above table, catastrophic consequences would involve loss of life, major
  consequences include serious injury or major economic loss, moderate
  consequences include minor injuries or moderate economic loss, and minor
  consequences include minor economic loss. Efforts to minimise risk should give
  priority to the activities that have an extreme or high risk rating.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Identify Hazards</h3>

  <p>To conduct your own risk assessment, begin by defining a scope of work. Identify 
    hazards relating to your scope. The list should be long and comprehensive and may 
    include anything.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Calculate Likelihood</h3>

<p>For each hazard, determine the likelihood it will occur. This can be measured as a probability (a 90 per cent chance) or as a 
  frequency (twice a year). Then, based on the likelihood, choose which bracket accurately describes the probability:
<ol>
<li><b>Unlikely.</b> An unlikely hazard is extremely rare, there is a less than 10 per cent chance that it will happen.</li>
<li><b>Seldom.</b> Seldom hazards are those that happen about 10 to 35 per cent of the time.</li>
<li><b>Occasional.</b> An occasional hazard will happen between 35 and 65 per cent of the time.</li>
<li><b>Likely.</b> A likely hazard has a 65 to 90 per cent probability of occurring.</li>
<li><b>Definite.</b> These hazards will occur 90 to 100 per cent of the time. You can be nearly certain it will manifest.</li>
</ol></p>

<h3>Step 3: Calculate Consequences</h3>

<p>In the same fashion as above, calculate potential loss using either quantitative measurements (dollar), qualitative 
  measurements (descriptive scale) or a mix of both. Then, based on the magnitude of the consequences, choose which 
  bracket accurately describes the losses:
<ol>
<li><b>Insignificant.</b> The consequences are insignificant and may cause a near negligible amount of damage. This 
  hazard poses no real threat. Examples: loss of $1K, no media coverage and/or no bodily harm.</li>
<li><b>Marginal.</b> The consequences are marginal and may cause only minor damage. This hazard is unlikely to have 
  a huge impact. Examples: loss of $10K, local media coverage and/or minor bodily harm.</li>
<li><b>Moderate.</b> The consequences are moderate and may cause a sizeable amount of damage. This hazard cannot 
  be overlooked. Examples: loss of $100K, regional media coverage and/or minor bodily harm.</li>
<li><b>Critical.</b> The consequences are critical and may cause a great deal of damage. This hazard must be addressed 
  quickly. Examples: loss of $1M, national media coverage, major bodily harm and/or police involvement.</li>
<li><b>Catastrophic.</b> The consequences are catastrophic and may cause an unbearable amount of damage. This hazard 
  is a top priority. Examples: loss of $10M+, international media coverage, extreme bodily harm and/or police involvement.</li>
</ol></p>

<h3>Step 4: Calculate Risk Rating</h3>

<p>Assign each hazard with a corresponding risk rating, based on the likelihood and impact you’ve already calculated. For 
  example, a hazard that is very likely to happen and will have major losses will receive a higher risk rating than a 
  hazard that’s unlikely and will cause little harm. Risk ratings are based on your own opinion and divided into four brackets. 
  They are:
<ol>
<li><b>Low.</b> Low risks can be ignored or overlooked as they usually are not a significant threat. A definite hazard with 
  insignificant consequences, such as stubbing your toe, may be low risk.</li>
<li><b>Medium.</b> Medium risks require reasonable steps for prevention but they’re not a priority. A likely hazard with 
  marginal consequences, such as a small fall, may be medium risk.</li>
<li><b>High.</b> High risks call for immediate action. An occasional hazard with critical consequences, such as a major 
  car accident, may be high risk.</li>
<li><b>Extreme.</b> Extreme risks may cause significant damage, will definitely occur, or a mix of both. They’re a high 
  priority. An unlikely hazard with catastrophic consequences, such as an aircraft crash, is an extreme risk.</li>
</ol></p>

<h3>Step 5: Create an Action Plan</h3>

<p>Your risk action plan will outline steps to address a hazard, reduce its likelihood, reduce its impact and how to respond if it occurs.
  Depending on the severity of the hazard, you may wish to include notes about key team members (i.e., project manager, PR or 
  Communications Director, subject matter expert), preventative measures, and a response plan for media and stakeholders.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Plug the Data into a Matrix</h3>

<p>A risk assessment matrix simplifies the information from the risk assessment form, making it easier to pinpoint major 
threats in a single glance. This convenience makes it a key tool in the risk management process.
Every risk assessment matrix has two axes: one that measures the consequence impact and the other measures likelihood.
To use a risk matrix, extract the data from the risk assessment form and plug it into the matrix accordingly.</p>

<p>In the below table, <span style="color:green">green</span> is low risk, 
  <span style="color:yellow">yellow</span> is medium risk,
  <span style="color:orange">orange</span> is high risk,
  <span style="color:red">red</span> is extreme risk.</p>
