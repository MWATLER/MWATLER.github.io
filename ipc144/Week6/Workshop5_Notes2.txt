Here is one way of searching through your array of employees for a particular employee:

int found=0;//the found flag
int empId;//the employee's id
int empIndex;//index into the array
printf("Enter Employee ID: ");
scanf("%d", &empId);
int i;
for (i = 0; (i < SIZE) && (found == 0); ++i) {
	if (emp[i].id == empId) {
		found = 1;
		empIndex = i;
	}
}
if (found == 0) printf("*** ERROR: Employee ID not found! ***\n");

Keep in mind the variables found, empId, empIndex, and i will be used in many parts of the program so they are best declared just below main().
