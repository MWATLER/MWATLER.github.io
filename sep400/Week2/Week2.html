<h3>Sample Code</h3>

<p><em>Static Libraries</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>We looked at a <a href="static/MathLib/Makefile" target="_blank">Makefile</a> for building a static library libMath.a from the files
    <a href="static/MathLib/General.cpp" target="_blank">General.cpp</a>,
    <a href="static/MathLib/Geometry.cpp" target="_blank">Geometry.cpp</a>, and
    <a href="static/MathLib/Conversions.cpp" target="_blank">Conversions.cpp</a>.
    This Makefile also had an "install" rule to copy the static library along with the header files to a general place.
    </li>
    <li>We looked at a <a href="static/MathApp/Makefile" target="_blank">Makefile</a> for that links in the static library libMath.a
    with its header files to build MathTest with the following CPP file:
    <a href="static/MathApp/MathTest.cpp" target="_blank">MathTest.cpp</a>.
    </li>
  <li>To look at symbols in a static library we can use the <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/nm" target="_blank">nm</a> command:<br>
  <b>$ nm libMath.a</b></li>
  <li>To display the table of contents of an archive, we can use <b>ar tv</b>, where <b>t</b> represents the table of contents and <b>v</b> indicates verbose:<br>
  <b>$ ar tv libMath.a</b></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Shared Libraries</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>This <a href="shared/MathLib/Makefile" target="_blank">Makefile</a>
    creates a shared library from the following files:
    <a href="shared/MathLib/General.cpp" target="_blank">General.cpp</a>,
    <a href="shared/MathLib/Geometry.cpp" target="_blank">Geometry.cpp</a>, and
    <a href="shared/MathLib/Conversions.cpp" target="_blank">Conversions.cpp</a>.
    This Makefile also had an "install" rule to copy the shared library to /usr/local/lib and the header files to a common place.
    <b>ldconfig</b> has to be executed on the command line to tell the system that the shared library is ready for use by everyone.
    </li>
    <li>And this <a href="shared/MathApp/Makefile" target="_blank">Makefile</a> links in a shared library libMath.so
    with its header files to build the MathTest executable with the following CPP file:
    <a href="shared/MathApp/MathTest.cpp" target="_blank">MathTest.cpp</a>.
    </li>
    <li>To look at the dynamic dependencies within a shared library we can use the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ldd.1.html" target="_blank">ldd</a> command:<br>
    <b>$ ldd libMath.so</b></li>
    <li>Shared libraries are often collections of other shared libraries, but if there are any functions defined within a shared library, they can also be seen with
      the <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/nm" target="_blank">nm</a> command.</li>
    <li>After a shared library is created, it must be made available to the entire system. This can be achieved with
      the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ldconfig.8.html" target="_blank">ldconfig</a> command.</li>
  </ul>

<p><em>Static Libraries vs Shared Libraries</em></p>
<p>Because  they  provide  several  advantages  over  static  libraries,  shared  libraries are  the  predominant  type  of  library  in  use
  on  contemporary  UNIX  systems.  The advantages of shared libraries spring primarily from the fact that when a program is linked against the
  library, copies of the object modules required by the program are  not  included  in  the  resulting  executable.  Instead,  the  (static)
  linker  merely includes  information  in  the  executable  file  about  the  shared  libraries  that  are required at run time. When the file
  is executed, the dynamic linker uses this information  to  load  the  required  shared  libraries.  At  run  time,  all  programs  using
  the same  shared  library  share  a  single  copy  of  that  library  in  memory.  Since  shared libraries are not copied into executable
  files, and a single memory-resident copy of the  shared  library  is  employed  by  all  programs  at  run  time,  shared  libraries
  reduce the amount of disk space and memory required by the system</p>
<p>Although it is almost always preferable to use shared libraries, there are occasional
  situations  where  static  libraries  may  be  appropriate.  In  particular,  the  fact  that  a
  statically linked application contains all of the code that it requires at run time can
  be advantageous. For example, static linking is  useful  if  the  user  can’t,  or  doesn’t
  wish to, install a shared library on the system where the program is to be used, or if
  the  program  is  to  be  run  in  an  environment  (perhaps  a  chroot  jail,  for  example)
  where  shared  libraries  are  unavailable.  In  addition,  even  a  compatible  shared
  library upgrade may unintentionally introduce a bug that breaks an application. By
  linking an application statically, we can ensure that it is immune to changes in the
  shared libraries on a system and that it has all of the code it requires to run (at the
  expense  of  a  larger  program  size,  and  consequent  increased  disk  and  memory
  requirements).</p>

<p><em>File I/O</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>For an example of a program that simply copies a file from one location to another, see <a href="SimpleFile/SimpleFile.cpp" target="_blank">SimpleFile.cpp</a>.</li>
  <li>For an example of a program that does exactly the same thing but uses lseek to start 100 bytes into the input file, see <a href="SimpleFile/SeekFile.cpp" target="_blank">SeekFile.cpp</a>.</li>
  <li>For a simple makefile to create these, see <a href="SimpleFile/Makefile" target="_blank">Makefile</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>GDB - a Linux debugger</em></p>
<ul>
<li>We looked briefly at the Linux debugger <b>GDB</b>. A tutorial on GDB can be found at
    <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~gilpin/tutorial/" target="_blank">Debugging Under Unix: gdb Tutorial</a> or<br> 
    <a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/developer_guide/debugging-running-application" target="_blank">
	    Red Hat Customer Portal: Chapter 20. Debugging a Running Application</a>.<br><br>
    Source code that was used to demo GDB can be found at
    <a href="gdb/Makefile" target="_blank">Makefile</a>,
    <a href="gdb/Math.cpp" target="_blank">Math.cpp</a>,
    <a href="gdb/Math.h" target="_blank">Math.h</a>,
    <a href="gdb/Conversions.cpp" target="_blank">Conversions.cpp</a>,
    <a href="gdb/Conversions.h" target="_blank">Conversions.h</a>,
    <a href="gdb/General.cpp" target="_blank">General.cpp</a>,
    <a href="gdb/General.h" target="_blank">General.h</a>,
    <a href="gdb/Geometry.cpp" target="_blank">Geometry.cpp</a>,
    <a href="gdb/Geometry.h" target="_blank">Geometry.h</a>.<br>
    In this source code the function <b>CelsiusToFahrenheit</b> was made to crash when the flag <b>CRASH</b> was enabled in the <b>Makefile</b>.
  </li>
  <li>
    To run a program with the gdb debugger, for example <b>Math</b>, execute the following from the command line:<br>
    <b>$ gdb ./Math</b><br>
    Then run the program from the gdb console:<br>
    <b>(gdb) run</b><br>
    If the program crashes, you can execute the backtrace command from within the gdb console to see the flow of function calls that led to the crash:<br>
    <b>(gdb) bt</b><br><br>
    To attach gdb to an already existing process, first get the process id then execute gdb attach. For instance, say <b>Math</b> is already running
    and has pid 5467:<br>
    <b>$ gdb attach 5467</b>
  </li>
  <li>Valgrind is also available on Linux for testing whether your program has a memory leak. You can install valgrind as follows:<br>
  <b>$ sudo apt install valgrind</b></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Advanced File I/O, Debugging with The Standard Error Channel</em></p>
<ul>
 <li>Sometimes it is useful to duplicate a file descriptor and redirect output from or to a file. The source code for a file which redirects the standard error 
   channel via <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/dup.2.html" target="_blank">dup() and dup2()</a> can be found in <a href="dup/fileDup.cpp" target="_blank">fileDup.cpp</a></li>
 <li>For real time operations, it is not possible to halt your program and look at the values of your variables. Rather, you print debug data to a file while
  your program is running, and you watch that file. One method of monitoring that debug file is with the system command <b>tail - f</b>. Therefore,
  you redirect all data to <b>cerr</b> to a debug file (ie <b>ErrorLog.txt</b>) and you watch that file in a separate window.
  Be sure to enable a debug flag in your <b>Makefile</b> (ie <b>DEBUG</b>) and use it in your code. Your code can
  therefore run in debug mode (<b>DEBUG</b> is enabled in the <b>Makefile</b>) or normal mode (<b>DEBUG</b> is disabled in the <b>Makefile</b>).<br><br>
      Source code that was used to demonstrate real-time debugging with cerr can be found at
      <a href="debug/Makefile" target="_blank">Makefile</a>,
      <a href="debug/Math.cpp" target="_blank">Math.cpp</a>,
      <a href="debug/Math.h" target="_blank">Math.h</a>,
      <a href="debug/Conversions.cpp" target="_blank">Conversions.cpp</a>,
      <a href="debug/Conversions.h" target="_blank">Conversions.h</a>,
      <a href="debug/General.cpp" target="_blank">General.cpp</a>,
      <a href="debug/General.h" target="_blank">General.h</a>,
      <a href="debug/Geometry.cpp" target="_blank">Geometry.cpp</a>,
      <a href="debug/Geometry.h" target="_blank">Geometry.h</a>.<br>
      In this source code the function <b>CelsiusToFahrenheit</b> was made to crash when the flag <b>CRASH</b> was enabled in the <b>Makefile</b>.<br>
      The real time debug mode was set when the flag <b>DEBUG</b> was enabled  in the <b>Makefile</b>. Debug exists in <b>Math.cpp</b> and <b>Conversions.cpp</b> only.
