<h1>Week 12 - April 3-7</h1>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This week we are going to look at security issues within an operating system. We will look at the RSA encryption alorithm. 
    We will also look at authentication and encryption with openssl.

<h3>Sample Code</h3>

<p><em>RSA Encryption</em></p>
<ul>
    <li> The idea of RSA is based on the fact that it is difficult to factorize a large integer. The public key 
        consists of two numbers where one number is multiplication of two large prime numbers. And private key 
        is also derived from the same two prime numbers. So if somebody can factorize the large number, the 
        private key is compromised. Therefore encryption strength totally lies on the key size and if we double 
        or triple the key size, the strength of encryption increases exponentially. RSA keys can be typically 
        1024 or 2048 bits long, but experts believe that 1024 bit keys could be broken in the near future. But 
        till now it seems to be an infeasible task. Sample code that demonstrates RSA for small values can be found at:<br>
        <a href="rsa/Makefile" target="_blank">Makefile</a> and
        <a href="rsa/rsa.cpp" target="_blank">rsa.cpp</a>.
     </li>
</ul>

<p><em>OpenSSL</em></p>
<ul>
    <li>An SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is the standard security protocol used to establish an encrypted connection 
        between a server and a client. After establishing the connection SSL/TLS ensures that the data transmitted 
        between server and client are secured and intact. There are two parts to SSL. The first is the 
        handshake, or the authentication. For this a certificate is required. The second part is the encryption 
        of the data. To run SSL on a Linux machine, we have to first install the OpenSSL library:<br>
<b>$ sudo apt-get install libssl-dev</b><br><br>
Before compiling the client and server program you will need a Certificate. You can generate your own certificate
using the below command:<br>
<b>$ openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:1024 -keyout mycert.pem -out mycert.pem</b><br>
<b>Note:</b> Here certificate name is <b>mycert.pem</b>.<br>
<b>Note:</b> 1024 bit RSA might be too small. You might wish to use 2048 instead.<br><br>
<b>Note:</b> In the following demonstration code, you will have to generate a certificate for both the 
server and client. it is therefore best to keep the server and client in separate directories:
        <a href="openssl/client/Makefile" target="_blank">client/Makefile</a>,
        <a href="openssl/client/client.cpp" target="_blank">client/client.cpp</a>,
        <a href="openssl/server/Makefile" target="_blank">server/Makefile</a> and
        <a href="openssl/server/server.cpp" target="_blank">server/server.cpp</a>.
     </li>
</ul>
