<h2>SEP400 - Assignment 2: Seismic Data Acquisition Unit</h2>

<h3>Due: Friday, April 14, 2023</h3>

<h4><b><u>Business Case</u></b> (Marketing, Project Manager, Senior Executives)</h4>
<p>The release of energy associated with earthquakes generates seismic waves that propagate through the 
    Earth and along the Earth's surface across large distances. Most earthquakes are the result of plate tectonic processes. 
    The geological monitoring of the Earth's surface provides guidance for determining the status and trends of geological 
    activity, and to further the understanding of how geologic processes impact our ecosystem.</p>

<p>A transducer has been purchased by our company, which converts seismic waves into streams of binary data. This data has to reach our 
    data centers for analysis. We need a data acquisition unit that will collect data from our transducer and transmit these data 
    over the network to data centers. In doing so, our data acquisition unit must protect against rogue data centers which might 
    attempt to steal the data or disrupt network communications.</p>

<p>The purpose of this project is therefore to write software for the data acquisition unit given the transducer 
    and data centers.</p>

<h4><b><u>Requirements</u></b> (Marketing, Project Manager, Project Lead)</h4>
<ul>
<li>The data acquisition unit must quickly retrieve the data from the transducer.</li>
<li>The data acquisition unit must accept subscription requests from data centers through password authentication.</li>
<li>The data acquisition unit must quickly transmit all data to all subscribed data centers (losing some data is acceptable).</li>
<li>The data acquisition unit must protect against any rogue process that attempts to guess the subscription password by brute force.</li>
<li>The data acquisition unit must protect against any rogue process that attempts a denial of service attack by spamming the data acquisition unit with 
    large amounts of data.</li>
</ul>

<h4><b><u>Design</u></b> (Project Lead, Senior Engineers)</h4>

<b>The Transducer:</b>
<ul>
    <li>The manufacturers of the transducer are aware of the requirement for quick data transfer, therefore have designed the transducer 
        to write streams of data into shared memory.</li>
    <li>The transducer therefore allows the software for the data acquistion unit to run on the transducer so they can share memory.</li>
    <li>The transducer data streams are of fixed length. Metadata (data about the data) is included with each data stream.</li>
    <li>The transducer data streams are written into a finite area of memory. They therefore overwrite each other after a while.</li>
</ul>

<b>The Seismic Data Acquisition Unit:</b>
<ul>
    <li>The seismic data acquisition unit retrieves data from the transducer through shared memory.</li>
    <li>The seismic data acquisition unit synchronizes its data retrieval with the transducer's data write.</li>
    <li>The IP address of the seismic data acquisition unit is known to all data centers.</li>
    <li>The seismic data acquisition unit uses INET datagram sockets to accept subscriptions from data centers with authentication via password.</li>
    <li>The seismic data acquisition unit uses INET datagram sockets to transmit streams of seismic data to all subscribed data centers.</li>
    <li>The seismic data acquisition unit uses mutex'es to synchronize its data retrieval via INET datagram sockets with its data transmit via INET datagram sockets.</li>
    <li>The seismic data acquisition unit keeps track of the history of data center activity to detect rogue data centers which might try to guess the 
        password by brute force.</li>
    <li>The seismic data acquisition unit keeps track of the history of data center activity to detect rogue data centers which might try to overwhelm it with 
        massive amounts of data.</li>
    <li>The seismic data acquisition unit uses INET datagram sockets to accept cancellation of a data center's subscription.</li>
    </ul>

<b>The Data Center:</b>
<ul>
    <li>The data center attempts to authenticate with the data acquisition unit using INET datagram sockets by providing a data stream consisting of the username and password.</li>
    <li>If authentication fails, the data center will try again after 5 seconds.</li>
    <li>Once authenticated, the data center will retrieve data for 30 seconds from the data acquistion unit using INET datagram sockets, then cancel its subscription.</li>
</ul>
