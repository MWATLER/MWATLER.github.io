le:ACT I
le:PROLOGUE
le:
le:    Two households, both alike in dignity,
le:    In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
le:    From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
le:    Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
le:    From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
le:    A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
le:    Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
le:    Do with their death bury their parents' strife.
le:    The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
le:    And the continuance of their parents' rage,
le:    Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,
le:    Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
le:    The which if you with patient ears attend,
le:    What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
le:
le:SCENE I. Verona. A public place.
le:
le:    Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers 
le:
le:SAMPSON
le:
le:    Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.
le:
le:GREGORY
le:
le:    No, for then we should be colliers.
le:
le:SAMPSON
le:
le:    I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.
le:
le:GREGORY
le:
le:    Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.
le:
le:SAMPSON
le:
le:    I strike quickly, being moved.
le:
le:GREGORY
le:
le:    But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
le:
le:SAMPSON
le:
le:    A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
le:
le:GREGORY
le:
le:    To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:
le:    therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.
le:
le:SAMPSON
le:
le:    A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will
le:    take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.
le:
le:GREGORY
le:
le:    That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes
le:    to the wall.
le:
le:SAMPSON
le:
le:    True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,
le:    are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push
le:    Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids
le:    to the wall.
le:
le:GREGORY
le:
le:    The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.
le:
le:SAMPSON
le:
le:    'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I
le:    have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the
le:    maids, and cut off their heads.
le:
le:GREGORY
le:
le:    The heads of the maids?
le:
le:SAMPSON
le:
le:    Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;
le:    take it in what sense thou wilt.
le:
le:GREGORY
le:
le:    They must take it in sense that feel it.
le:
le:SAMPSON
le:
le:    Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and
le:    'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.
le:
le:GREGORY
le:
le:    'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou
le:    hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes
le:    two of the house of the Montagues.
le:
le:SAMPSON
le:
le:    My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.
le:
le:GREGORY
le:
le:    How! turn thy back and run?
le:
le:SAMPSON
le:
le:    Fear me not.
le:
le:GREGORY
le:
le:    No, marry; I fear thee!
le:
le:SAMPSON
le:
le:    Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.
le:
le:GREGORY
le:
le:    I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as
le:    they list.
le:
le:SAMPSON
le:
le:    Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them;
le:    which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
le:
le:    Enter ABRAHAM and BALTHASAR
le:
le:ABRAHAM
le:
le:    Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
le:
le:SAMPSON
le:
le:    I do bite my thumb, sir.
le:
le:ABRAHAM
le:
le:    Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
le:
le:SAMPSON
le:
le:    [Aside to GREGORY] Is the law of our side, if I say
le:    ay?
le:
le:GREGORY
le:
le:    No.
le:
le:SAMPSON
le:
le:    No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I
le:    bite my thumb, sir.
le:
le:GREGORY
le:
le:    Do you quarrel, sir?
le:
le:ABRAHAM
le:
le:    Quarrel sir! no, sir.
le:
le:SAMPSON
le:
le:    If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you.
le:
le:ABRAHAM
le:
le:    No better.
le:
le:SAMPSON
le:
le:    Well, sir.
le:
le:GREGORY
le:
le:    Say 'better:' here comes one of my master's kinsmen.
le:
le:SAMPSON
le:
le:    Yes, better, sir.
le:
le:ABRAHAM
le:
le:    You lie.
le:
le:SAMPSON
le:
le:    Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.
le:
le:    They fight
le:
le:    Enter BENVOLIO
le:
le:BENVOLIO
le:
le:    Part, fools!
le:    Put up your swords; you know not what you do.
le:
le:    Beats down their swords
le:
le:    Enter TYBALT
le:
le:TYBALT
le:
le:    What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
le:    Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.
le:
le:BENVOLIO
le:
le:    I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,
le:    Or manage it to part these men with me.
le:
le:TYBALT
le:
le:    What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word,
le:    As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:
le:    Have at thee, coward!
le:
le:    They fight
le:
le:    Enter, several of both houses, who join the fray; then enter Citizens, with clubs
le:
le:First Citizen
le:
le:    Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!
le:    Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!
le:
le:    Enter CAPULET in his gown, and LADY CAPULET
le:
le:CAPULET
le:
le:    What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!
le:
le:LADY CAPULET
le:
le:    A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?
le:
le:CAPULET
le:
le:    My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,
le:    And flourishes his blade in spite of me.
le:
le:    Enter MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE
le:
le:MONTAGUE
le:
le:    Thou villain Capulet,--Hold me not, let me go.
le:
le:LADY MONTAGUE
le:
le:    Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.
le:
le:    Enter PRINCE, with Attendants
le:
le:PRINCE
le:
le:    Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
le:    Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,--
le:    Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,
le:    That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
le:    With purple fountains issuing from your veins,
le:    On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
le:    Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,
le:    And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
le:    Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
le:    By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
le:    Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,
le:    And made Verona's ancient citizens
le:    Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
le:    To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
le:    Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:
le:    If ever you disturb our streets again,
le:    Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
le:    For this time, all the rest depart away:
le:    You Capulet; shall go along with me:
le:    And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
le:    To know our further pleasure in this case,
le:    To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.
le:    Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
le:
le:    Exeunt all but MONTAGUE, LADY MONTAGUE, and BENVOLIO
le:
le:MONTAGUE
le:
le:    Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
le:    Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?
le:
le:BENVOLIO
le:
le:    Here were the servants of your adversary,
le:    And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:
le:    I drew to part them: in the instant came
le:    The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,
le:    Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,
le:    He swung about his head and cut the winds,
le:    Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn:
le:    While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
le:    Came more and more and fought on part and part,
le:    Till the prince came, who parted either part.
le:
le:LADY MONTAGUE
le:
le:    O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?
le:    Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
le:
le:BENVOLIO
le:
le:    Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
le:    Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,
le:    A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
le:    Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
le:    That westward rooteth from the city's side,
le:    So early walking did I see your son:
le:    Towards him I made, but he was ware of me
le:    And stole into the covert of the wood:
le:    I, measuring his affections by my own,
le:    That most are busied when they're most alone,
le:    Pursued my humour not pursuing his,
le:    And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.
le:
le:MONTAGUE
le:
le:    Many a morning hath he there been seen,
le:    With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.
le:    Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
le:    But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
le:    Should in the furthest east begin to draw
le:    The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
le:    Away from the light steals home my heavy son,
le:    And private in his chamber pens himself,
le:    Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out
le:    And makes himself an artificial night:
le:    Black and portentous must this humour prove,
le:    Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
le:
le:BENVOLIO
le:
le:    My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
le:
le:MONTAGUE
le:
le:    I neither know it nor can learn of him.
le:
le:BENVOLIO
le:
le:    Have you importuned him by any means?
le:
le:MONTAGUE
le:
le:    Both by myself and many other friends:
le:    But he, his own affections' counsellor,
le:    Is to himself--I will not say how true--
le:    But to himself so secret and so close,
le:    So far from sounding and discovery,
le:    As is the bud bit with an envious worm,
le:    Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
le:    Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
le:    Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.
le:    We would as willingly give cure as know.
le:
le:    Enter ROMEO
le:
le:BENVOLIO
le:
le:    See, where he comes: so please you, step aside;
le:    I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.
le:
le:MONTAGUE
le:
le:    I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,
le:    To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away.
le:
le:    Exeunt MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE
le:
le:BENVOLIO
le:
le:    Good-morrow, cousin.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Is the day so young?
le:
le:BENVOLIO
le:
le:    But new struck nine.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Ay me! sad hours seem long.
le:    Was that my father that went hence so fast?
le:
le:BENVOLIO
le:
le:    It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
le:
le:BENVOLIO
le:
le:    In love?
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Out--
le:
le:BENVOLIO
le:
le:    Of love?
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Out of her favour, where I am in love.
le:
le:BENVOLIO
le:
le:    Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,
le:    Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,
le:    Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!
le:    Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
le:    Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
le:    Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
le:    Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
le:    O any thing, of nothing first create!
le:    O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
le:    Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
le:    Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,
le:    sick health!
le:    Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
le:    This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
le:    Dost thou not laugh?
le:
le:BENVOLIO
le:
le:    No, coz, I rather weep.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Good heart, at what?
le:
le:BENVOLIO
le:
le:    At thy good heart's oppression.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Why, such is love's transgression.
le:    Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
le:    Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest
le:    With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown
le:    Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
le:    Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;
le:    Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
le:    Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:
le:    What is it else? a madness most discreet,
le:    A choking gall and a preserving sweet.
le:    Farewell, my coz.
le:
le:BENVOLIO
le:
le:    Soft! I will go along;
le:    An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Tut, I have lost myself; I am not here;
le:    This is not Romeo, he's some other where.
le:
le:BENVOLIO
le:
le:    Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    What, shall I groan and tell thee?
le:
le:BENVOLIO
le:
le:    Groan! why, no.
le:    But sadly tell me who.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Bid a sick man in sadness make his will:
le:    Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill!
le:    In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
le:
le:BENVOLIO
le:
le:    I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    A right good mark-man! And she's fair I love.
le:
le:BENVOLIO
le:
le:    A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit
le:    With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;
le:    And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
le:    From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
le:    She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
le:    Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,
le:    Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:
le:    O, she is rich in beauty, only poor,
le:    That when she dies with beauty dies her store.
le:
le:BENVOLIO
le:
le:    Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,
le:    For beauty starved with her severity
le:    Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
le:    She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
le:    To merit bliss by making me despair:
le:    She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
le:    Do I live dead that live to tell it now.
le:
le:BENVOLIO
le:
le:    Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    O, teach me how I should forget to think.
le:
le:BENVOLIO
le:
le:    By giving liberty unto thine eyes;
le:    Examine other beauties.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    'Tis the way
le:    To call hers exquisite, in question more:
le:    These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows
le:    Being black put us in mind they hide the fair;
le:    He that is strucken blind cannot forget
le:    The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:
le:    Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
le:    What doth her beauty serve, but as a note
le:    Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
le:    Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.
le:
le:BENVOLIO
le:
le:    I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.
le:
le:    Exeunt
le:
le:SCENE II. A street.
le:
le:    Enter CAPULET, PARIS, and Servant 
le:
le:CAPULET
le:
le:    But Montague is bound as well as I,
le:    In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,
le:    For men so old as we to keep the peace.
le:
le:PARIS
le:
le:    Of honourable reckoning are you both;
le:    And pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.
le:    But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?
le:
le:CAPULET
le:
le:    But saying o'er what I have said before:
le:    My child is yet a stranger in the world;
le:    She hath not seen the change of fourteen years,
le:    Let two more summers wither in their pride,
le:    Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
le:
le:PARIS
le:
le:    Younger than she are happy mothers made.
le:
le:CAPULET
le:
le:    And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
le:    The earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she,
le:    She is the hopeful lady of my earth:
le:    But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,
le:    My will to her consent is but a part;
le:    An she agree, within her scope of choice
le:    Lies my consent and fair according voice.
le:    This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,
le:    Whereto I have invited many a guest,
le:    Such as I love; and you, among the store,
le:    One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
le:    At my poor house look to behold this night
le:    Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
le:    Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
le:    When well-apparell'd April on the heel
le:    Of limping winter treads, even such delight
le:    Among fresh female buds shall you this night
le:    Inherit at my house; hear all, all see,
le:    And like her most whose merit most shall be:
le:    Which on more view, of many mine being one
le:    May stand in number, though in reckoning none,
le:    Come, go with me.
le:
le:    To Servant, giving a paper
le:    Go, sirrah, trudge about
le:    Through fair Verona; find those persons out
le:    Whose names are written there, and to them say,
le:    My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.
le:
le:    Exeunt CAPULET and PARIS
le:
le:Servant
le:
le:    Find them out whose names are written here! It is
le:    written, that the shoemaker should meddle with his
le:    yard, and the tailor with his last, the fisher with
le:    his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am
le:    sent to find those persons whose names are here
le:    writ, and can never find what names the writing
le:    person hath here writ. I must to the learned.--In good time.
le:
le:    Enter BENVOLIO and ROMEO
le:
le:BENVOLIO
le:
le:    Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning,
le:    One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish;
le:    Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
le:    One desperate grief cures with another's languish:
le:    Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
le:    And the rank poison of the old will die.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that.
le:
le:BENVOLIO
le:
le:    For what, I pray thee?
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    For your broken shin.
le:
le:BENVOLIO
le:
le:    Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is;
le:    Shut up in prison, kept without my food,
le:    Whipp'd and tormented and--God-den, good fellow.
le:
le:Servant
le:
le:    God gi' god-den. I pray, sir, can you read?
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.
le:
le:Servant
le:
le:    Perhaps you have learned it without book: but, I
le:    pray, can you read any thing you see?
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Ay, if I know the letters and the language.
le:
le:Servant
le:
le:    Ye say honestly: rest you merry!
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Stay, fellow; I can read.
le:
le:    Reads
le:    'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;
le:    County Anselme and his beauteous sisters; the lady
le:    widow of Vitravio; Signior Placentio and his lovely
le:    nieces; Mercutio and his brother Valentine; mine
le:    uncle Capulet, his wife and daughters; my fair niece
le:    Rosaline; Livia; Signior Valentio and his cousin
le:    Tybalt, Lucio and the lively Helena.' A fair
le:    assembly: whither should they come?
le:
le:Servant
le:
le:    Up.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Whither?
le:
le:Servant
le:
le:    To supper; to our house.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Whose house?
le:
le:Servant
le:
le:    My master's.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Indeed, I should have ask'd you that before.
le:
le:Servant
le:
le:    Now I'll tell you without asking: my master is the
le:    great rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house
le:    of Montagues, I pray, come and crush a cup of wine.
le:    Rest you merry!
le:
le:    Exit
le:
le:BENVOLIO
le:
le:    At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
le:    Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lovest,
le:    With all the admired beauties of Verona:
le:    Go thither; and, with unattainted eye,
le:    Compare her face with some that I shall show,
le:    And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    When the devout religion of mine eye
le:    Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;
le:    And these, who often drown'd could never die,
le:    Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!
le:    One fairer than my love! the all-seeing sun
le:    Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.
le:
le:BENVOLIO
le:
le:    Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,
le:    Herself poised with herself in either eye:
le:    But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd
le:    Your lady's love against some other maid
le:    That I will show you shining at this feast,
le:    And she shall scant show well that now shows best.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,
le:    But to rejoice in splendor of mine own.
le:
le:    Exeunt
le:
le:SCENE III. A room in Capulet's house.
le:
le:    Enter LADY CAPULET and Nurse 
le:
le:LADY CAPULET
le:
le:    Nurse, where's my daughter? call her forth to me.
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,
le:    I bade her come. What, lamb! what, ladybird!
le:    God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet!
le:
le:    Enter JULIET
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    How now! who calls?
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    Your mother.
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    Madam, I am here.
le:    What is your will?
le:
le:LADY CAPULET
le:
le:    This is the matter:--Nurse, give leave awhile,
le:    We must talk in secret:--nurse, come back again;
le:    I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel.
le:    Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.
le:
le:LADY CAPULET
le:
le:    She's not fourteen.
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    I'll lay fourteen of my teeth,--
le:    And yet, to my teeth be it spoken, I have but four--
le:    She is not fourteen. How long is it now
le:    To Lammas-tide?
le:
le:LADY CAPULET
le:
le:    A fortnight and odd days.
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    Even or odd, of all days in the year,
le:    Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.
le:    Susan and she--God rest all Christian souls!--
le:    Were of an age: well, Susan is with God;
le:    She was too good for me: but, as I said,
le:    On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;
le:    That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
le:    'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
le:    And she was wean'd,--I never shall forget it,--
le:    Of all the days of the year, upon that day:
le:    For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
le:    Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;
le:    My lord and you were then at Mantua:--
le:    Nay, I do bear a brain:--but, as I said,
le:    When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
le:    Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
le:    To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!
le:    Shake quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow,
le:    To bid me trudge:
le:    And since that time it is eleven years;
le:    For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood,
le:    She could have run and waddled all about;
le:    For even the day before, she broke her brow:
le:    And then my husband--God be with his soul!
le:    A' was a merry man--took up the child:
le:    'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?
le:    Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
le:    Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame,
le:    The pretty wretch left crying and said 'Ay.'
le:    To see, now, how a jest shall come about!
le:    I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,
le:    I never should forget it: 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he;
le:    And, pretty fool, it stinted and said 'Ay.'
le:
le:LADY CAPULET
le:
le:    Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    Yes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh,
le:    To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'
le:    And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow
le:    A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone;
le:    A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:
le:    'Yea,' quoth my husband,'fall'st upon thy face?
le:    Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;
le:    Wilt thou not, Jule?' it stinted and said 'Ay.'
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!
le:    Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed:
le:    An I might live to see thee married once,
le:    I have my wish.
le:
le:LADY CAPULET
le:
le:    Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme
le:    I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,
le:    How stands your disposition to be married?
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    It is an honour that I dream not of.
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    An honour! were not I thine only nurse,
le:    I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.
le:
le:LADY CAPULET
le:
le:    Well, think of marriage now; younger than you,
le:    Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
le:    Are made already mothers: by my count,
le:    I was your mother much upon these years
le:    That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:
le:    The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    A man, young lady! lady, such a man
le:    As all the world--why, he's a man of wax.
le:
le:LADY CAPULET
le:
le:    Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.
le:
le:LADY CAPULET
le:
le:    What say you? can you love the gentleman?
le:    This night you shall behold him at our feast;
le:    Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,
le:    And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;
le:    Examine every married lineament,
le:    And see how one another lends content
le:    And what obscured in this fair volume lies
le:    Find written in the margent of his eyes.
le:    This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
le:    To beautify him, only lacks a cover:
le:    The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride
le:    For fair without the fair within to hide:
le:    That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,
le:    That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
le:    So shall you share all that he doth possess,
le:    By having him, making yourself no less.
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    No less! nay, bigger; women grow by men.
le:
le:LADY CAPULET
le:
le:    Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    I'll look to like, if looking liking move:
le:    But no more deep will I endart mine eye
le:    Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.
le:
le:    Enter a Servant
le:
le:Servant
le:
le:    Madam, the guests are come, supper served up, you
le:    called, my young lady asked for, the nurse cursed in
le:    the pantry, and every thing in extremity. I must
le:    hence to wait; I beseech you, follow straight.
le:
le:LADY CAPULET
le:
le:    We follow thee.
le:
le:    Exit Servant
le:    Juliet, the county stays.
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
le:
le:    Exeunt
le:
le:SCENE IV. A street.
le:
le:    Enter ROMEO, MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, with five or six Maskers, Torch-bearers, and others 
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
le:    Or shall we on without a apology?
le:
le:BENVOLIO
le:
le:    The date is out of such prolixity:
le:    We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,
le:    Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,
le:    Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;
le:    Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
le:    After the prompter, for our entrance:
le:    But let them measure us by what they will;
le:    We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Give me a torch: I am not for this ambling;
le:    Being but heavy, I will bear the light.
le:
le:MERCUTIO
le:
le:    Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Not I, believe me: you have dancing shoes
le:    With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
le:    So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
le:
le:MERCUTIO
le:
le:    You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,
le:    And soar with them above a common bound.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
le:    To soar with his light feathers, and so bound,
le:    I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:
le:    Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
le:
le:MERCUTIO
le:
le:    And, to sink in it, should you burden love;
le:    Too great oppression for a tender thing.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,
le:    Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.
le:
le:MERCUTIO
le:
le:    If love be rough with you, be rough with love;
le:    Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
le:    Give me a case to put my visage in:
le:    A visor for a visor! what care I
le:    What curious eye doth quote deformities?
le:    Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.
le:
le:BENVOLIO
le:
le:    Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in,
le:    But every man betake him to his legs.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    A torch for me: let wantons light of heart
le:    Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels,
le:    For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase;
le:    I'll be a candle-holder, and look on.
le:    The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.
le:
le:MERCUTIO
le:
le:    Tut, dun's the mouse, the constable's own word:
le:    If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
le:    Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st
le:    Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Nay, that's not so.
le:
le:MERCUTIO
le:
le:    I mean, sir, in delay
le:    We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.
le:    Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
le:    Five times in that ere once in our five wits.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    And we mean well in going to this mask;
le:    But 'tis no wit to go.
le:
le:MERCUTIO
le:
le:    Why, may one ask?
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    I dream'd a dream to-night.
le:
le:MERCUTIO
le:
le:    And so did I.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Well, what was yours?
le:
le:MERCUTIO
le:
le:    That dreamers often lie.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
le:
le:MERCUTIO
le:
le:    O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
le:    She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
le:    In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
le:    On the fore-finger of an alderman,
le:    Drawn with a team of little atomies
le:    Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;
le:    Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs,
le:    The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,
le:    The traces of the smallest spider's web,
le:    The collars of the moonshine's watery beams,
le:    Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,
le:    Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,
le:    Not so big as a round little worm
le:    Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
le:    Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut
le:    Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
le:    Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
le:    And in this state she gallops night by night
le:    Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
le:    O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight,
le:    O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees,
le:    O'er ladies ' lips, who straight on kisses dream,
le:    Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
le:    Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:
le:    Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
le:    And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
le:    And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail
le:    Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep,
le:    Then dreams, he of another benefice:
le:    Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,
le:    And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
le:    Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
le:    Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon
le:    Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,
le:    And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two
le:    And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
le:    That plats the manes of horses in the night,
le:    And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,
le:    Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes:
le:    This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
le:    That presses them and learns them first to bear,
le:    Making them women of good carriage:
le:    This is she--
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!
le:    Thou talk'st of nothing.
le:
le:MERCUTIO
le:
le:    True, I talk of dreams,
le:    Which are the children of an idle brain,
le:    Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,
le:    Which is as thin of substance as the air
le:    And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
le:    Even now the frozen bosom of the north,
le:    And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,
le:    Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.
le:
le:BENVOLIO
le:
le:    This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves;
le:    Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    I fear, too early: for my mind misgives
le:    Some consequence yet hanging in the stars
le:    Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
le:    With this night's revels and expire the term
le:    Of a despised life closed in my breast
le:    By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
le:    But He, that hath the steerage of my course,
le:    Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.
le:
le:BENVOLIO
le:
le:    Strike, drum.
le:
le:    Exeunt
le:
le:SCENE V. A hall in Capulet's house.
le:
le:    Musicians waiting. Enter Servingmen with napkins 
le:
le:First Servant
le:
le:    Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away? He
le:    shift a trencher? he scrape a trencher!
le:
le:Second Servant
le:
le:    When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's
le:    hands and they unwashed too, 'tis a foul thing.
le:
le:First Servant
le:
le:    Away with the joint-stools, remove the
le:    court-cupboard, look to the plate. Good thou, save
le:    me a piece of marchpane; and, as thou lovest me, let
le:    the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.
le:    Antony, and Potpan!
le:
le:Second Servant
le:
le:    Ay, boy, ready.
le:
le:First Servant
le:
le:    You are looked for and called for, asked for and
le:    sought for, in the great chamber.
le:
le:Second Servant
le:
le:    We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys; be
le:    brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all.
le:
le:    Enter CAPULET, with JULIET and others of his house, meeting the Guests and Maskers
le:
le:CAPULET
le:
le:    Welcome, gentlemen! ladies that have their toes
le:    Unplagued with corns will have a bout with you.
le:    Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all
le:    Will now deny to dance? she that makes dainty,
le:    She, I'll swear, hath corns; am I come near ye now?
le:    Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day
le:    That I have worn a visor and could tell
le:    A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,
le:    Such as would please: 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone:
le:    You are welcome, gentlemen! come, musicians, play.
le:    A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.
le:
le:    Music plays, and they dance
le:    More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up,
le:    And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.
le:    Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.
le:    Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet;
le:    For you and I are past our dancing days:
le:    How long is't now since last yourself and I
le:    Were in a mask?
le:
le:Second Capulet
le:
le:    By'r lady, thirty years.
le:
le:CAPULET
le:
le:    What, man! 'tis not so much, 'tis not so much:
le:    'Tis since the nuptials of Lucentio,
le:    Come pentecost as quickly as it will,
le:    Some five and twenty years; and then we mask'd.
le:
le:Second Capulet
le:
le:    'Tis more, 'tis more, his son is elder, sir;
le:    His son is thirty.
le:
le:CAPULET
le:
le:    Will you tell me that?
le:    His son was but a ward two years ago.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    [To a Servingman] What lady is that, which doth
le:    enrich the hand
le:    Of yonder knight?
le:
le:Servant
le:
le:    I know not, sir.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
le:    It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
le:    Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear;
le:    Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
le:    So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,
le:    As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
le:    The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand,
le:    And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
le:    Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight!
le:    For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
le:
le:TYBALT
le:
le:    This, by his voice, should be a Montague.
le:    Fetch me my rapier, boy. What dares the slave
le:    Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,
le:    To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
le:    Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
le:    To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.
le:
le:CAPULET
le:
le:    Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
le:
le:TYBALT
le:
le:    Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe,
le:    A villain that is hither come in spite,
le:    To scorn at our solemnity this night.
le:
le:CAPULET
le:
le:    Young Romeo is it?
le:
le:TYBALT
le:
le:    'Tis he, that villain Romeo.
le:
le:CAPULET
le:
le:    Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone;
le:    He bears him like a portly gentleman;
le:    And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
le:    To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth:
le:    I would not for the wealth of all the town
le:    Here in my house do him disparagement:
le:    Therefore be patient, take no note of him:
le:    It is my will, the which if thou respect,
le:    Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
le:    And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.
le:
le:TYBALT
le:
le:    It fits, when such a villain is a guest:
le:    I'll not endure him.
le:
le:CAPULET
le:
le:    He shall be endured:
le:    What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to;
le:    Am I the master here, or you? go to.
le:    You'll not endure him! God shall mend my soul!
le:    You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
le:    You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!
le:
le:TYBALT
le:
le:    Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.
le:
le:CAPULET
le:
le:    Go to, go to;
le:    You are a saucy boy: is't so, indeed?
le:    This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what:
le:    You must contrary me! marry, 'tis time.
le:    Well said, my hearts! You are a princox; go:
le:    Be quiet, or--More light, more light! For shame!
le:    I'll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts!
le:
le:TYBALT
le:
le:    Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
le:    Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
le:    I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall
le:    Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall.
le:
le:    Exit
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    [To JULIET] If I profane with my unworthiest hand
le:    This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:
le:    My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
le:    To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
le:    Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
le:    For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
le:    And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do;
le:    They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take.
le:    Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Sin from thy lips? O trespass sweetly urged!
le:    Give me my sin again.
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    You kiss by the book.
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    Madam, your mother craves a word with you.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    What is her mother?
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    Marry, bachelor,
le:    Her mother is the lady of the house,
le:    And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous
le:    I nursed her daughter, that you talk'd withal;
le:    I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
le:    Shall have the chinks.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Is she a Capulet?
le:    O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.
le:
le:BENVOLIO
le:
le:    Away, begone; the sport is at the best.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
le:
le:CAPULET
le:
le:    Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;
le:    We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.
le:    Is it e'en so? why, then, I thank you all
le:    I thank you, honest gentlemen; good night.
le:    More torches here! Come on then, let's to bed.
le:    Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late:
le:    I'll to my rest.
le:
le:    Exeunt all but JULIET and Nurse
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    The son and heir of old Tiberio.
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    What's he that now is going out of door?
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    Marry, that, I think, be young Petrucio.
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    What's he that follows there, that would not dance?
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    I know not.
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    Go ask his name: if he be married.
le:    My grave is like to be my wedding bed.
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    His name is Romeo, and a Montague;
le:    The only son of your great enemy.
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    My only love sprung from my only hate!
le:    Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
le:    Prodigious birth of love it is to me,
le:    That I must love a loathed enemy.
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    What's this? what's this?
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    A rhyme I learn'd even now
le:    Of one I danced withal.
le:
le:    One calls within 'Juliet.'
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    Anon, anon!
le:    Come, let's away; the strangers all are gone.
le:
le:    Exeunt
le:
le:ACT II
le:PROLOGUE
le:
le:    Enter Chorus 
le:
le:Chorus
le:
le:    Now old desire doth in his death-bed lie,
le:    And young affection gapes to be his heir;
le:    That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,
le:    With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.
le:    Now Romeo is beloved and loves again,
le:    Alike betwitched by the charm of looks,
le:    But to his foe supposed he must complain,
le:    And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks:
le:    Being held a foe, he may not have access
le:    To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;
le:    And she as much in love, her means much less
le:    To meet her new-beloved any where:
le:    But passion lends them power, time means, to meet
le:    Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.
le:
le:    Exit
le:
le:SCENE I. A lane by the wall of Capulet's orchard.
le:
le:    Enter ROMEO 
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Can I go forward when my heart is here?
le:    Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.
le:
le:    He climbs the wall, and leaps down within it
le:
le:    Enter BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO
le:
le:BENVOLIO
le:
le:    Romeo! my cousin Romeo!
le:
le:MERCUTIO
le:
le:    He is wise;
le:    And, on my lie, hath stol'n him home to bed.
le:
le:BENVOLIO
le:
le:    He ran this way, and leap'd this orchard wall:
le:    Call, good Mercutio.
le:
le:MERCUTIO
le:
le:    Nay, I'll conjure too.
le:    Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
le:    Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh:
le:    Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;
le:    Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove;'
le:    Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
le:    One nick-name for her purblind son and heir,
le:    Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim,
le:    When King Cophetua loved the beggar-maid!
le:    He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;
le:    The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.
le:    I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes,
le:    By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
le:    By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh
le:    And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
le:    That in thy likeness thou appear to us!
le:
le:BENVOLIO
le:
le:    And if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.
le:
le:MERCUTIO
le:
le:    This cannot anger him: 'twould anger him
le:    To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle
le:    Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
le:    Till she had laid it and conjured it down;
le:    That were some spite: my invocation
le:    Is fair and honest, and in his mistres s' name
le:    I conjure only but to raise up him.
le:
le:BENVOLIO
le:
le:    Come, he hath hid himself among these trees,
le:    To be consorted with the humorous night:
le:    Blind is his love and best befits the dark.
le:
le:MERCUTIO
le:
le:    If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
le:    Now will he sit under a medlar tree,
le:    And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
le:    As maids call medlars, when they laugh alone.
le:    Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
le:    An open et caetera, thou a poperin pear!
le:    Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed;
le:    This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep:
le:    Come, shall we go?
le:
le:BENVOLIO
le:
le:    Go, then; for 'tis in vain
le:    To seek him here that means not to be found.
le:
le:    Exeunt
le:
le:SCENE II. Capulet's orchard.
le:
le:    Enter ROMEO 
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
le:
le:    JULIET appears above at a window
le:    But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
le:    It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
le:    Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
le:    Who is already sick and pale with grief,
le:    That thou her maid art far more fair than she:
le:    Be not her maid, since she is envious;
le:    Her vestal livery is but sick and green
le:    And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.
le:    It is my lady, O, it is my love!
le:    O, that she knew she were!
le:    She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?
le:    Her eye discourses; I will answer it.
le:    I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:
le:    Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
le:    Having some business, do entreat her eyes
le:    To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
le:    What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
le:    The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
le:    As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
le:    Would through the airy region stream so bright
le:    That birds would sing and think it were not night.
le:    See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
le:    O, that I were a glove upon that hand,
le:    That I might touch that cheek!
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    Ay me!
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    She speaks:
le:    O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art
le:    As glorious to this night, being o'er my head
le:    As is a winged messenger of heaven
le:    Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes
le:    Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
le:    When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds
le:    And sails upon the bosom of the air.
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
le:    Deny thy father and refuse thy name;
le:    Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
le:    And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    [Aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;
le:    Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
le:    What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,
le:    Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
le:    Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
le:    What's in a name? that which we call a rose
le:    By any other name would smell as sweet;
le:    So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
le:    Retain that dear perfection which he owes
le:    Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,
le:    And for that name which is no part of thee
le:    Take all myself.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    I take thee at thy word:
le:    Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;
le:    Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night
le:    So stumblest on my counsel?
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    By a name
le:    I know not how to tell thee who I am:
le:    My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
le:    Because it is an enemy to thee;
le:    Had I it written, I would tear the word.
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
le:    Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:
le:    Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
le:    The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
le:    And the place death, considering who thou art,
le:    If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;
le:    For stony limits cannot hold love out,
le:    And what love can do that dares love attempt;
le:    Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
le:    Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,
le:    And I am proof against their enmity.
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    I would not for the world they saw thee here.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
le:    And but thou love me, let them find me here:
le:    My life were better ended by their hate,
le:    Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    By whose direction found'st thou out this place?
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    By love, who first did prompt me to inquire;
le:    He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.
le:    I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
le:    As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,
le:    I would adventure for such merchandise.
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,
le:    Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
le:    For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night
le:    Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny
le:    What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!
le:    Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'
le:    And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,
le:    Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries
le:    Then say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
le:    If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
le:    Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,
le:    I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay,
le:    So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.
le:    In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
le:    And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light:
le:    But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true
le:    Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
le:    I should have been more strange, I must confess,
le:    But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,
le:    My true love's passion: therefore pardon me,
le:    And not impute this yielding to light love,
le:    Which the dark night hath so discovered.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear
le:    That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,
le:    That monthly changes in her circled orb,
le:    Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    What shall I swear by?
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    Do not swear at all;
le:    Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
le:    Which is the god of my idolatry,
le:    And I'll believe thee.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    If my heart's dear love--
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,
le:    I have no joy of this contract to-night:
le:    It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;
le:    Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
le:    Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
le:    This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
le:    May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
le:    Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest
le:    Come to thy heart as that within my breast!
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    I gave thee mine before thou didst request it:
le:    And yet I would it were to give again.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    But to be frank, and give it thee again.
le:    And yet I wish but for the thing I have:
le:    My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
le:    My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
le:    The more I have, for both are infinite.
le:
le:    Nurse calls within
le:    I hear some noise within; dear love, adieu!
le:    Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.
le:    Stay but a little, I will come again.
le:
le:    Exit, above
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard.
le:    Being in night, all this is but a dream,
le:    Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.
le:
le:    Re-enter JULIET, above
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
le:    If that thy bent of love be honourable,
le:    Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,
le:    By one that I'll procure to come to thee,
le:    Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;
le:    And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
le:    And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    [Within] Madam!
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    I come, anon.--But if thou mean'st not well,
le:    I do beseech thee--
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    [Within] Madam!
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    By and by, I come:--
le:    To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief:
le:    To-morrow will I send.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    So thrive my soul--
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    A thousand times good night!
le:
le:    Exit, above
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    A thousand times the worse, to want thy light.
le:    Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from
le:    their books,
le:    But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
le:
le:    Retiring
le:
le:    Re-enter JULIET, above
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    Hist! Romeo, hist! O, for a falconer's voice,
le:    To lure this tassel-gentle back again!
le:    Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud;
le:    Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
le:    And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,
le:    With repetition of my Romeo's name.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    It is my soul that calls upon my name:
le:    How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
le:    Like softest music to attending ears!
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    Romeo!
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    My dear?
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    At what o'clock to-morrow
le:    Shall I send to thee?
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    At the hour of nine.
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    I will not fail: 'tis twenty years till then.
le:    I have forgot why I did call thee back.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Let me stand here till thou remember it.
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
le:    Remembering how I love thy company.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
le:    Forgetting any other home but this.
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone:
le:    And yet no further than a wanton's bird;
le:    Who lets it hop a little from her hand,
le:    Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
le:    And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
le:    So loving-jealous of his liberty.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    I would I were thy bird.
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    Sweet, so would I:
le:    Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
le:    Good night, good night! parting is such
le:    sweet sorrow,
le:    That I shall say good night till it be morrow.
le:
le:    Exit above
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!
le:    Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!
le:    Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,
le:    His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell.
le:
le:    Exit
le:
le:SCENE III. Friar Laurence's cell.
le:
le:    Enter FRIAR LAURENCE, with a basket 
le:
le:FRIAR LAURENCE
le:
le:    The grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night,
le:    Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light,
le:    And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
le:    From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels:
le:    Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,
le:    The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,
le:    I must up-fill this osier cage of ours
le:    With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
le:    The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb;
le:    What is her burying grave that is her womb,
le:    And from her womb children of divers kind
le:    We sucking on her natural bosom find,
le:    Many for many virtues excellent,
le:    None but for some and yet all different.
le:    O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
le:    In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities:
le:    For nought so vile that on the earth doth live
le:    But to the earth some special good doth give,
le:    Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use
le:    Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse:
le:    Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied;
le:    And vice sometimes by action dignified.
le:    Within the infant rind of this small flower
le:    Poison hath residence and medicine power:
le:    For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;
le:    Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.
le:    Two such opposed kings encamp them still
le:    In man as well as herbs, grace and rude will;
le:    And where the worser is predominant,
le:    Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
le:
le:    Enter ROMEO
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Good morrow, father.
le:
le:FRIAR LAURENCE
le:
le:    Benedicite!
le:    What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
le:    Young son, it argues a distemper'd head
le:    So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed:
le:    Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,
le:    And where care lodges, sleep will never lie;
le:    But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain
le:    Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign:
le:    Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
le:    Thou art up-roused by some distemperature;
le:    Or if not so, then here I hit it right,
le:    Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
le:
le:FRIAR LAURENCE
le:
le:    God pardon sin! wast thou with Rosaline?
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    With Rosaline, my ghostly father? no;
le:    I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.
le:
le:FRIAR LAURENCE
le:
le:    That's my good son: but where hast thou been, then?
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    I'll tell thee, ere thou ask it me again.
le:    I have been feasting with mine enemy,
le:    Where on a sudden one hath wounded me,
le:    That's by me wounded: both our remedies
le:    Within thy help and holy physic lies:
le:    I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,
le:    My intercession likewise steads my foe.
le:
le:FRIAR LAURENCE
le:
le:    Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;
le:    Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
le:    On the fair daughter of rich Capulet:
le:    As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;
le:    And all combined, save what thou must combine
le:    By holy marriage: when and where and how
le:    We met, we woo'd and made exchange of vow,
le:    I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
le:    That thou consent to marry us to-day.
le:
le:FRIAR LAURENCE
le:
le:    Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!
le:    Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear,
le:    So soon forsaken? young men's love then lies
le:    Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
le:    Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine
le:    Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!
le:    How much salt water thrown away in waste,
le:    To season love, that of it doth not taste!
le:    The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
le:    Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears;
le:    Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
le:    Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet:
le:    If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine,
le:    Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline:
le:    And art thou changed? pronounce this sentence then,
le:    Women may fall, when there's no strength in men.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
le:
le:FRIAR LAURENCE
le:
le:    For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    And bad'st me bury love.
le:
le:FRIAR LAURENCE
le:
le:    Not in a grave,
le:    To lay one in, another out to have.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    I pray thee, chide not; she whom I love now
le:    Doth grace for grace and love for love allow;
le:    The other did not so.
le:
le:FRIAR LAURENCE
le:
le:    O, she knew well
le:    Thy love did read by rote and could not spell.
le:    But come, young waverer, come, go with me,
le:    In one respect I'll thy assistant be;
le:    For this alliance may so happy prove,
le:    To turn your households' rancour to pure love.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
le:
le:FRIAR LAURENCE
le:
le:    Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.
le:
le:    Exeunt
le:
le:SCENE IV. A street.
le:
le:    Enter BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO 
le:
le:MERCUTIO
le:
le:    Where the devil should this Romeo be?
le:    Came he not home to-night?
le:
le:BENVOLIO
le:
le:    Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
le:
le:MERCUTIO
le:
le:    Ah, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline.
le:    Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.
le:
le:BENVOLIO
le:
le:    Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet,
le:    Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
le:
le:MERCUTIO
le:
le:    A challenge, on my life.
le:
le:BENVOLIO
le:
le:    Romeo will answer it.
le:
le:MERCUTIO
le:
le:    Any man that can write may answer a letter.
le:
le:BENVOLIO
le:
le:    Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he
le:    dares, being dared.
le:
le:MERCUTIO
le:
le:    Alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a
le:    white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a
le:    love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the
le:    blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to
le:    encounter Tybalt?
le:
le:BENVOLIO
le:
le:    Why, what is Tybalt?
le:
le:MERCUTIO
le:
le:    More than prince of cats, I can tell you. O, he is
le:    the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as
le:    you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance, and
le:    proportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two, and
le:    the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk
le:    button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the
le:    very first house, of the first and second cause:
le:    ah, the immortal passado! the punto reverso! the
le:    hai!
le:
le:BENVOLIO
le:
le:    The what?
le:
le:MERCUTIO
le:
le:    The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting
le:    fantasticoes; these new tuners of accents! 'By Jesu,
le:    a very good blade! a very tall man! a very good
le:    whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,
le:    grandsire, that we should be thus afflicted with
le:    these strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these
le:    perdona-mi's, who stand so much on the new form,
le:    that they cannot at ease on the old bench? O, their
le:    bones, their bones!
le:
le:    Enter ROMEO
le:
le:BENVOLIO
le:
le:    Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo.
le:
le:MERCUTIO
le:
le:    Without his roe, like a dried herring: flesh, flesh,
le:    how art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers
le:    that Petrarch flowed in: Laura to his lady was but a
le:    kitchen-wench; marry, she had a better love to
le:    be-rhyme her; Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a gipsy;
le:    Helen and Hero hildings and harlots; Thisbe a grey
le:    eye or so, but not to the purpose. Signior
le:    Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation
le:    to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit
le:    fairly last night.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
le:
le:MERCUTIO
le:
le:    The ship, sir, the slip; can you not conceive?
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in
le:    such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.
le:
le:MERCUTIO
le:
le:    That's as much as to say, such a case as yours
le:    constrains a man to bow in the hams.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Meaning, to court'sy.
le:
le:MERCUTIO
le:
le:    Thou hast most kindly hit it.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    A most courteous exposition.
le:
le:MERCUTIO
le:
le:    Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Pink for flower.
le:
le:MERCUTIO
le:
le:    Right.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Why, then is my pump well flowered.
le:
le:MERCUTIO
le:
le:    Well said: follow me this jest now till thou hast
le:    worn out thy pump, that when the single sole of it
le:    is worn, the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    O single-soled jest, solely singular for the
le:    singleness.
le:
le:MERCUTIO
le:
le:    Come between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Switch and spurs, switch and spurs; or I'll cry a match.
le:
le:MERCUTIO
le:
le:    Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I have
le:    done, for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of
le:    thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five:
le:    was I with you there for the goose?
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast
le:    not there for the goose.
le:
le:MERCUTIO
le:
le:    I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Nay, good goose, bite not.
le:
le:MERCUTIO
le:
le:    Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most
le:    sharp sauce.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    And is it not well served in to a sweet goose?
le:
le:MERCUTIO
le:
le:    O here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an
le:    inch narrow to an ell broad!
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    I stretch it out for that word 'broad;' which added
le:    to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.
le:
le:MERCUTIO
le:
le:    Why, is not this better now than groaning for love?
le:    now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art
le:    thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature:
le:    for this drivelling love is like a great natural,
le:    that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.
le:
le:BENVOLIO
le:
le:    Stop there, stop there.
le:
le:MERCUTIO
le:
le:    Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.
le:
le:BENVOLIO
le:
le:    Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.
le:
le:MERCUTIO
le:
le:    O, thou art deceived; I would have made it short:
le:    for I was come to the whole depth of my tale; and
le:    meant, indeed, to occupy the argument no longer.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Here's goodly gear!
le:
le:    Enter Nurse and PETER
le:
le:MERCUTIO
le:
le:    A sail, a sail!
le:
le:BENVOLIO
le:
le:    Two, two; a shirt and a smock.
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    Peter!
le:
le:PETER
le:
le:    Anon!
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    My fan, Peter.
le:
le:MERCUTIO
le:
le:    Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the
le:    fairer face.
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    God ye good morrow, gentlemen.
le:
le:MERCUTIO
le:
le:    God ye good den, fair gentlewoman.
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    Is it good den?
le:
le:MERCUTIO
le:
le:    'Tis no less, I tell you, for the bawdy hand of the
le:    dial is now upon the prick of noon.
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    Out upon you! what a man are you!
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to
le:    mar.
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    By my troth, it is well said; 'for himself to mar,'
le:    quoth a'? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I
le:    may find the young Romeo?
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when
le:    you have found him than he was when you sought him:
le:    I am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse.
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    You say well.
le:
le:MERCUTIO
le:
le:    Yea, is the worst well? very well took, i' faith;
le:    wisely, wisely.
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    if you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with
le:    you.
le:
le:BENVOLIO
le:
le:    She will indite him to some supper.
le:
le:MERCUTIO
le:
le:    A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! so ho!
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    What hast thou found?
le:
le:MERCUTIO
le:
le:    No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie,
le:    that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent.
le:
le:    Sings
le:    An old hare hoar,
le:    And an old hare hoar,
le:    Is very good meat in lent
le:    But a hare that is hoar
le:    Is too much for a score,
le:    When it hoars ere it be spent.
le:    Romeo, will you come to your father's? we'll
le:    to dinner, thither.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    I will follow you.
le:
le:MERCUTIO
le:
le:    Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,
le:
le:    Singing
le:    'lady, lady, lady.'
le:
le:    Exeunt MERCUTIO and BENVOLIO
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    Marry, farewell! I pray you, sir, what saucy
le:    merchant was this, that was so full of his ropery?
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk,
le:    and will speak more in a minute than he will stand
le:    to in a month.
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    An a' speak any thing against me, I'll take him
le:    down, an a' were lustier than he is, and twenty such
le:    Jacks; and if I cannot, I'll find those that shall.
le:    Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am
le:    none of his skains-mates. And thou must stand by
le:    too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure?
le:
le:PETER
le:
le:    I saw no man use you a pleasure; if I had, my weapon
le:    should quickly have been out, I warrant you: I dare
le:    draw as soon as another man, if I see occasion in a
le:    good quarrel, and the law on my side.
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    Now, afore God, I am so vexed, that every part about
le:    me quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word:
le:    and as I told you, my young lady bade me inquire you
le:    out; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself:
le:    but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her into
le:    a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross
le:    kind of behavior, as they say: for the gentlewoman
le:    is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double
le:    with her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered
le:    to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I
le:    protest unto thee--
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    Good heart, and, i' faith, I will tell her as much:
le:    Lord, Lord, she will be a joyful woman.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    What wilt thou tell her, nurse? thou dost not mark me.
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    I will tell her, sir, that you do protest; which, as
le:    I take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Bid her devise
le:    Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;
le:    And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell
le:    Be shrived and married. Here is for thy pains.
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    No truly sir; not a penny.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Go to; I say you shall.
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    This afternoon, sir? well, she shall be there.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall:
le:    Within this hour my man shall be with thee
le:    And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair;
le:    Which to the high top-gallant of my joy
le:    Must be my convoy in the secret night.
le:    Farewell; be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains:
le:    Farewell; commend me to thy mistress.
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    What say'st thou, my dear nurse?
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,
le:    Two may keep counsel, putting one away?
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    I warrant thee, my man's as true as steel.
le:
le:NURSE
le:
le:    Well, sir; my mistress is the sweetest lady--Lord,
le:    Lord! when 'twas a little prating thing:--O, there
le:    is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that would fain
le:    lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief
le:    see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her
le:    sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer
le:    man; but, I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks
le:    as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not
le:    rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter?
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Ay, nurse; what of that? both with an R.
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    Ah. mocker! that's the dog's name; R is for
le:    the--No; I know it begins with some other
le:    letter:--and she hath the prettiest sententious of
le:    it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you good
le:    to hear it.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Commend me to thy lady.
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    Ay, a thousand times.
le:
le:    Exit Romeo
le:    Peter!
le:
le:PETER
le:
le:    Anon!
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    Peter, take my fan, and go before and apace.
le:
le:    Exeunt
le:
le:SCENE V. Capulet's orchard.
le:
le:    Enter JULIET 
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;
le:    In half an hour she promised to return.
le:    Perchance she cannot meet him: that's not so.
le:    O, she is lame! love's heralds should be thoughts,
le:    Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,
le:    Driving back shadows over louring hills:
le:    Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw love,
le:    And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
le:    Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
le:    Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve
le:    Is three long hours, yet she is not come.
le:    Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
le:    She would be as swift in motion as a ball;
le:    My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
le:    And his to me:
le:    But old folks, many feign as they were dead;
le:    Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.
le:    O God, she comes!
le:
le:    Enter Nurse and PETER
le:    O honey nurse, what news?
le:    Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    Peter, stay at the gate.
le:
le:    Exit PETER
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    Now, good sweet nurse,--O Lord, why look'st thou sad?
le:    Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
le:    If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news
le:    By playing it to me with so sour a face.
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    I am a-weary, give me leave awhile:
le:    Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I had!
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:
le:    Nay, come, I pray thee, speak; good, good nurse, speak.
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    Jesu, what haste? can you not stay awhile?
le:    Do you not see that I am out of breath?
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath
le:    To say to me that thou art out of breath?
le:    The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
le:    Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
le:    Is thy news good, or bad? answer to that;
le:    Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance:
le:    Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not
le:    how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his
le:    face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels
le:    all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
le:    though they be not to be talked on, yet they are
le:    past compare: he is not the flower of courtesy,
le:    but, I'll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy
le:    ways, wench; serve God. What, have you dined at home?
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    No, no: but all this did I know before.
le:    What says he of our marriage? what of that?
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I!
le:    It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
le:    My back o' t' other side,--O, my back, my back!
le:    Beshrew your heart for sending me about,
le:    To catch my death with jaunting up and down!
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
le:    Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a
le:    courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I
le:    warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    Where is my mother! why, she is within;
le:    Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!
le:    'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
le:    Where is your mother?'
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    O God's lady dear!
le:    Are you so hot? marry, come up, I trow;
le:    Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
le:    Henceforward do your messages yourself.
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    Here's such a coil! come, what says Romeo?
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    I have.
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;
le:    There stays a husband to make you a wife:
le:    Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,
le:    They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.
le:    Hie you to church; I must another way,
le:    To fetch a ladder, by the which your love
le:    Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark:
le:    I am the drudge and toil in your delight,
le:    But you shall bear the burden soon at night.
le:    Go; I'll to dinner: hie you to the cell.
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.
le:
le:    Exeunt
le:
le:SCENE VI. Friar Laurence's cell.
le:
le:    Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and ROMEO 
le:
le:FRIAR LAURENCE
le:
le:    So smile the heavens upon this holy act,
le:    That after hours with sorrow chide us not!
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Amen, amen! but come what sorrow can,
le:    It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
le:    That one short minute gives me in her sight:
le:    Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
le:    Then love-devouring death do what he dare;
le:    It is enough I may but call her mine.
le:
le:FRIAR LAURENCE
le:
le:    These violent delights have violent ends
le:    And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
le:    Which as they kiss consume: the sweetest honey
le:    Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
le:    And in the taste confounds the appetite:
le:    Therefore love moderately; long love doth so;
le:    Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.
le:
le:    Enter JULIET
le:    Here comes the lady: O, so light a foot
le:    Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint:
le:    A lover may bestride the gossamer
le:    That idles in the wanton summer air,
le:    And yet not fall; so light is vanity.
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    Good even to my ghostly confessor.
le:
le:FRIAR LAURENCE
le:
le:    Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    As much to him, else is his thanks too much.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
le:    Be heap'd like mine and that thy skill be more
le:    To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
le:    This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue
le:    Unfold the imagined happiness that both
le:    Receive in either by this dear encounter.
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
le:    Brags of his substance, not of ornament:
le:    They are but beggars that can count their worth;
le:    But my true love is grown to such excess
le:    I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.
le:
le:FRIAR LAURENCE
le:
le:    Come, come with me, and we will make short work;
le:    For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone
le:    Till holy church incorporate two in one.
le:
le:    Exeunt
le:
le:ACT III
le:SCENE I. A public place.
le:
le:    Enter MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, Page, and Servants 
le:
le:BENVOLIO
le:
le:    I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire:
le:    The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,
le:    And, if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl;
le:    For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.
le:
le:MERCUTIO
le:
le:    Thou art like one of those fellows that when he
le:    enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword
le:    upon the table and says 'God send me no need of
le:    thee!' and by the operation of the second cup draws
le:    it on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.
le:
le:BENVOLIO
le:
le:    Am I like such a fellow?
le:
le:MERCUTIO
le:
le:    Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as
le:    any in Italy, and as soon moved to be moody, and as
le:    soon moody to be moved.
le:
le:BENVOLIO
le:
le:    And what to?
le:
le:MERCUTIO
le:
le:    Nay, an there were two such, we should have none
le:    shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou! why,
le:    thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more,
le:    or a hair less, in his beard, than thou hast: thou
le:    wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no
le:    other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes: what
le:    eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?
le:    Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of
le:    meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as
le:    an egg for quarrelling: thou hast quarrelled with a
le:    man for coughing in the street, because he hath
le:    wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun:
le:    didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing
le:    his new doublet before Easter? with another, for
le:    tying his new shoes with old riband? and yet thou
le:    wilt tutor me from quarrelling!
le:
le:BENVOLIO
le:
le:    An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man
le:    should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.
le:
le:MERCUTIO
le:
le:    The fee-simple! O simple!
le:
le:BENVOLIO
le:
le:    By my head, here come the Capulets.
le:
le:MERCUTIO
le:
le:    By my heel, I care not.
le:
le:    Enter TYBALT and others
le:
le:TYBALT
le:
le:    Follow me close, for I will speak to them.
le:    Gentlemen, good den: a word with one of you.
le:
le:MERCUTIO
le:
le:    And but one word with one of us? couple it with
le:    something; make it a word and a blow.
le:
le:TYBALT
le:
le:    You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you
le:    will give me occasion.
le:
le:MERCUTIO
le:
le:    Could you not take some occasion without giving?
le:
le:TYBALT
le:
le:    Mercutio, thou consort'st with Romeo,--
le:
le:MERCUTIO
le:
le:    Consort! what, dost thou make us minstrels? an
le:    thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but
le:    discords: here's my fiddlestick; here's that shall
le:    make you dance. 'Zounds, consort!
le:
le:BENVOLIO
le:
le:    We talk here in the public haunt of men:
le:    Either withdraw unto some private place,
le:    And reason coldly of your grievances,
le:    Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.
le:
le:MERCUTIO
le:
le:    Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze;
le:    I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.
le:
le:    Enter ROMEO
le:
le:TYBALT
le:
le:    Well, peace be with you, sir: here comes my man.
le:
le:MERCUTIO
le:
le:    But I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery:
le:    Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower;
le:    Your worship in that sense may call him 'man.'
le:
le:TYBALT
le:
le:    Romeo, the hate I bear thee can afford
le:    No better term than this,--thou art a villain.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
le:    Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
le:    To such a greeting: villain am I none;
le:    Therefore farewell; I see thou know'st me not.
le:
le:TYBALT
le:
le:    Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
le:    That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    I do protest, I never injured thee,
le:    But love thee better than thou canst devise,
le:    Till thou shalt know the reason of my love:
le:    And so, good Capulet,--which name I tender
le:    As dearly as my own,--be satisfied.
le:
le:MERCUTIO
le:
le:    O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!
le:    Alla stoccata carries it away.
le:
le:    Draws
le:    Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?
le:
le:TYBALT
le:
le:    What wouldst thou have with me?
le:
le:MERCUTIO
le:
le:    Good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine
le:    lives; that I mean to make bold withal, and as you
le:    shall use me hereafter, drybeat the rest of the
le:    eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pitcher
le:    by the ears? make haste, lest mine be about your
le:    ears ere it be out.
le:
le:TYBALT
le:
le:    I am for you.
le:
le:    Drawing
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.
le:
le:MERCUTIO
le:
le:    Come, sir, your passado.
le:
le:    They fight
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.
le:    Gentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage!
le:    Tybalt, Mercutio, the prince expressly hath
le:    Forbidden bandying in Verona streets:
le:    Hold, Tybalt! good Mercutio!
le:
le:    TYBALT under ROMEO's arm stabs MERCUTIO, and flies with his followers
le:
le:MERCUTIO
le:
le:    I am hurt.
le:    A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.
le:    Is he gone, and hath nothing?
le:
le:BENVOLIO
le:
le:    What, art thou hurt?
le:
le:MERCUTIO
le:
le:    Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch; marry, 'tis enough.
le:    Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.
le:
le:    Exit Page
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much.
le:
le:MERCUTIO
le:
le:    No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a
le:    church-door; but 'tis enough,'twill serve: ask for
le:    me to-morrow, and you shall find me a grave man. I
le:    am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o'
le:    both your houses! 'Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a
le:    cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a
le:    rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of
le:    arithmetic! Why the devil came you between us? I
le:    was hurt under your arm.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    I thought all for the best.
le:
le:MERCUTIO
le:
le:    Help me into some house, Benvolio,
le:    Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!
le:    They have made worms' meat of me: I have it,
le:    And soundly too: your houses!
le:
le:    Exeunt MERCUTIO and BENVOLIO
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    This gentleman, the prince's near ally,
le:    My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt
le:    In my behalf; my reputation stain'd
le:    With Tybalt's slander,--Tybalt, that an hour
le:    Hath been my kinsman! O sweet Juliet,
le:    Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
le:    And in my temper soften'd valour's steel!
le:
le:    Re-enter BENVOLIO
le:
le:BENVOLIO
le:
le:    O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!
le:    That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds,
le:    Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    This day's black fate on more days doth depend;
le:    This but begins the woe, others must end.
le:
le:BENVOLIO
le:
le:    Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Alive, in triumph! and Mercutio slain!
le:    Away to heaven, respective lenity,
le:    And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now!
le:
le:    Re-enter TYBALT
le:    Now, Tybalt, take the villain back again,
le:    That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul
le:    Is but a little way above our heads,
le:    Staying for thine to keep him company:
le:    Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him.
le:
le:TYBALT
le:
le:    Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,
le:    Shalt with him hence.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    This shall determine that.
le:
le:    They fight; TYBALT falls
le:
le:BENVOLIO
le:
le:    Romeo, away, be gone!
le:    The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
le:    Stand not amazed: the prince will doom thee death,
le:    If thou art taken: hence, be gone, away!
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    O, I am fortune's fool!
le:
le:BENVOLIO
le:
le:    Why dost thou stay?
le:
le:    Exit ROMEO
le:
le:    Enter Citizens, & c
le:
le:First Citizen
le:
le:    Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?
le:    Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?
le:
le:BENVOLIO
le:
le:    There lies that Tybalt.
le:
le:First Citizen
le:
le:    Up, sir, go with me;
le:    I charge thee in the princes name, obey.
le:
le:    Enter Prince, attended; MONTAGUE, CAPULET, their Wives, and others
le:
le:PRINCE
le:
le:    Where are the vile beginners of this fray?
le:
le:BENVOLIO
le:
le:    O noble prince, I can discover all
le:    The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl:
le:    There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
le:    That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.
le:
le:LADY CAPULET
le:
le:    Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!
le:    O prince! O cousin! husband! O, the blood is spilt
le:    O my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,
le:    For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague.
le:    O cousin, cousin!
le:
le:PRINCE
le:
le:    Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?
le:
le:BENVOLIO
le:
le:    Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay;
le:    Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink
le:    How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal
le:    Your high displeasure: all this uttered
le:    With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd,
le:    Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
le:    Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts
le:    With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,
le:    Who all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
le:    And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
le:    Cold death aside, and with the other sends
le:    It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,
le:    Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
le:    'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and, swifter than
le:    his tongue,
le:    His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
le:    And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
le:    An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
le:    Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;
le:    But by and by comes back to Romeo,
le:    Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,
le:    And to 't they go like lightning, for, ere I
le:    Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain.
le:    And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
le:    This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.
le:
le:LADY CAPULET
le:
le:    He is a kinsman to the Montague;
le:    Affection makes him false; he speaks not true:
le:    Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
le:    And all those twenty could but kill one life.
le:    I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;
le:    Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.
le:
le:PRINCE
le:
le:    Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio;
le:    Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?
le:
le:MONTAGUE
le:
le:    Not Romeo, prince, he was Mercutio's friend;
le:    His fault concludes but what the law should end,
le:    The life of Tybalt.
le:
le:PRINCE
le:
le:    And for that offence
le:    Immediately we do exile him hence:
le:    I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,
le:    My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;
le:    But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine
le:    That you shall all repent the loss of mine:
le:    I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
le:    Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses:
le:    Therefore use none: let Romeo hence in haste,
le:    Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
le:    Bear hence this body and attend our will:
le:    Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.
le:
le:    Exeunt
le:
le:SCENE II. Capulet's orchard.
le:
le:    Enter JULIET 
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
le:    Towards Phoebus' lodging: such a wagoner
le:    As Phaethon would whip you to the west,
le:    And bring in cloudy night immediately.
le:    Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
le:    That runaway's eyes may wink and Romeo
le:    Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.
le:    Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
le:    By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,
le:    It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
le:    Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
le:    And learn me how to lose a winning match,
le:    Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods:
le:    Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,
le:    With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold,
le:    Think true love acted simple modesty.
le:    Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;
le:    For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
le:    Whiter than new snow on a raven's back.
le:    Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow'd night,
le:    Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,
le:    Take him and cut him out in little stars,
le:    And he will make the face of heaven so fine
le:    That all the world will be in love with night
le:    And pay no worship to the garish sun.
le:    O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
le:    But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold,
le:    Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day
le:    As is the night before some festival
le:    To an impatient child that hath new robes
le:    And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,
le:    And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks
le:    But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.
le:
le:    Enter Nurse, with cords
le:    Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords
le:    That Romeo bid thee fetch?
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    Ay, ay, the cords.
le:
le:    Throws them down
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    Ay me! what news? why dost thou wring thy hands?
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    Ah, well-a-day! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!
le:    We are undone, lady, we are undone!
le:    Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    Can heaven be so envious?
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    Romeo can,
le:    Though heaven cannot: O Romeo, Romeo!
le:    Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?
le:    This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.
le:    Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but 'I,'
le:    And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more
le:    Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice:
le:    I am not I, if there be such an I;
le:    Or those eyes shut, that make thee answer 'I.'
le:    If he be slain, say 'I'; or if not, no:
le:    Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,--
le:    God save the mark!--here on his manly breast:
le:    A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
le:    Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,
le:    All in gore-blood; I swounded at the sight.
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    O, break, my heart! poor bankrupt, break at once!
le:    To prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty!
le:    Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
le:    And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
le:    O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman!
le:    That ever I should live to see thee dead!
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    What storm is this that blows so contrary?
le:    Is Romeo slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead?
le:    My dear-loved cousin, and my dearer lord?
le:    Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!
le:    For who is living, if those two are gone?
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;
le:    Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    O God! did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    It did, it did; alas the day, it did!
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!
le:    Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
le:    Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!
le:    Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!
le:    Despised substance of divinest show!
le:    Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st,
le:    A damned saint, an honourable villain!
le:    O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell,
le:    When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
le:    In moral paradise of such sweet flesh?
le:    Was ever book containing such vile matter
le:    So fairly bound? O that deceit should dwell
le:    In such a gorgeous palace!
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    There's no trust,
le:    No faith, no honesty in men; all perjured,
le:    All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
le:    Ah, where's my man? give me some aqua vitae:
le:    These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
le:    Shame come to Romeo!
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    Blister'd be thy tongue
le:    For such a wish! he was not born to shame:
le:    Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit;
le:    For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd
le:    Sole monarch of the universal earth.
le:    O, what a beast was I to chide at him!
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
le:    Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,
le:    When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?
le:    But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
le:    That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband:
le:    Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring;
le:    Your tributary drops belong to woe,
le:    Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.
le:    My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;
le:    And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband:
le:    All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
le:    Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,
le:    That murder'd me: I would forget it fain;
le:    But, O, it presses to my memory,
le:    Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds:
le:    'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo--banished;'
le:    That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'
le:    Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death
le:    Was woe enough, if it had ended there:
le:    Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship
le:    And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,
le:    Why follow'd not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'
le:    Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,
le:    Which modern lamentations might have moved?
le:    But with a rear-ward following Tybalt's death,
le:    'Romeo is banished,' to speak that word,
le:    Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
le:    All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished!'
le:    There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
le:    In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.
le:    Where is my father, and my mother, nurse?
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse:
le:    Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    Wash they his wounds with tears: mine shall be spent,
le:    When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.
le:    Take up those cords: poor ropes, you are beguiled,
le:    Both you and I; for Romeo is exiled:
le:    He made you for a highway to my bed;
le:    But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
le:    Come, cords, come, nurse; I'll to my wedding-bed;
le:    And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    Hie to your chamber: I'll find Romeo
le:    To comfort you: I wot well where he is.
le:    Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night:
le:    I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    O, find him! give this ring to my true knight,
le:    And bid him come to take his last farewell.
le:
le:    Exeunt
le:
le:SCENE III. Friar Laurence's cell.
le:
le:    Enter FRIAR LAURENCE 
le:
le:FRIAR LAURENCE
le:
le:    Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man:
le:    Affliction is enamour'd of thy parts,
le:    And thou art wedded to calamity.
le:
le:    Enter ROMEO
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Father, what news? what is the prince's doom?
le:    What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,
le:    That I yet know not?
le:
le:FRIAR LAURENCE
le:
le:    Too familiar
le:    Is my dear son with such sour company:
le:    I bring thee tidings of the prince's doom.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    What less than dooms-day is the prince's doom?
le:
le:FRIAR LAURENCE
le:
le:    A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips,
le:    Not body's death, but body's banishment.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Ha, banishment! be merciful, say 'death;'
le:    For exile hath more terror in his look,
le:    Much more than death: do not say 'banishment.'
le:
le:FRIAR LAURENCE
le:
le:    Hence from Verona art thou banished:
le:    Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    There is no world without Verona walls,
le:    But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
le:    Hence-banished is banish'd from the world,
le:    And world's exile is death: then banished,
le:    Is death mis-term'd: calling death banishment,
le:    Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe,
le:    And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.
le:
le:FRIAR LAURENCE
le:
le:    O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!
le:    Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince,
le:    Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,
le:    And turn'd that black word death to banishment:
le:    This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    'Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here,
le:    Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog
le:    And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
le:    Live here in heaven and may look on her;
le:    But Romeo may not: more validity,
le:    More honourable state, more courtship lives
le:    In carrion-flies than Romeo: they my seize
le:    On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand
le:    And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
le:    Who even in pure and vestal modesty,
le:    Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;
le:    But Romeo may not; he is banished:
le:    Flies may do this, but I from this must fly:
le:    They are free men, but I am banished.
le:    And say'st thou yet that exile is not death?
le:    Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,
le:    No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
le:    But 'banished' to kill me?--'banished'?
le:    O friar, the damned use that word in hell;
le:    Howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart,
le:    Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
le:    A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,
le:    To mangle me with that word 'banished'?
le:
le:FRIAR LAURENCE
le:
le:    Thou fond mad man, hear me but speak a word.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.
le:
le:FRIAR LAURENCE
le:
le:    I'll give thee armour to keep off that word:
le:    Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,
le:    To comfort thee, though thou art banished.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!
le:    Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
le:    Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,
le:    It helps not, it prevails not: talk no more.
le:
le:FRIAR LAURENCE
le:
le:    O, then I see that madmen have no ears.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?
le:
le:FRIAR LAURENCE
le:
le:    Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel:
le:    Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
le:    An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
le:    Doting like me and like me banished,
le:    Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,
le:    And fall upon the ground, as I do now,
le:    Taking the measure of an unmade grave.
le:
le:    Knocking within
le:
le:FRIAR LAURENCE
le:
le:    Arise; one knocks; good Romeo, hide thyself.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,
le:    Mist-like, infold me from the search of eyes.
le:
le:    Knocking
le:
le:FRIAR LAURENCE
le:
le:    Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;
le:    Thou wilt be taken. Stay awhile! Stand up;
le:
le:    Knocking
le:    Run to my study. By and by! God's will,
le:    What simpleness is this! I come, I come!
le:
le:    Knocking
le:    Who knocks so hard? whence come you? what's your will?
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    [Within] Let me come in, and you shall know
le:    my errand;
le:    I come from Lady Juliet.
le:
le:FRIAR LAURENCE
le:
le:    Welcome, then.
le:
le:    Enter Nurse
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar,
le:    Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?
le:
le:FRIAR LAURENCE
le:
le:    There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    O, he is even in my mistress' case,
le:    Just in her case! O woful sympathy!
le:    Piteous predicament! Even so lies she,
le:    Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
le:    Stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man:
le:    For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand;
le:    Why should you fall into so deep an O?
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Nurse!
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Spakest thou of Juliet? how is it with her?
le:    Doth she not think me an old murderer,
le:    Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy
le:    With blood removed but little from her own?
le:    Where is she? and how doth she? and what says
le:    My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;
le:    And now falls on her bed; and then starts up,
le:    And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,
le:    And then down falls again.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    As if that name,
le:    Shot from the deadly level of a gun,
le:    Did murder her; as that name's cursed hand
le:    Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,
le:    In what vile part of this anatomy
le:    Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack
le:    The hateful mansion.
le:
le:    Drawing his sword
le:
le:FRIAR LAURENCE
le:
le:    Hold thy desperate hand:
le:    Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art:
le:    Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote
le:    The unreasonable fury of a beast:
le:    Unseemly woman in a seeming man!
le:    Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
le:    Thou hast amazed me: by my holy order,
le:    I thought thy disposition better temper'd.
le:    Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself?
le:    And stay thy lady too that lives in thee,
le:    By doing damned hate upon thyself?
le:    Why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?
le:    Since birth, and heaven, and earth, all three do meet
le:    In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
le:    Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit;
le:    Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,
le:    And usest none in that true use indeed
le:    Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit:
le:    Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,
le:    Digressing from the valour of a man;
le:    Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
le:    Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;
le:    Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
le:    Misshapen in the conduct of them both,
le:    Like powder in a skitless soldier's flask,
le:    Is set afire by thine own ignorance,
le:    And thou dismember'd with thine own defence.
le:    What, rouse thee, man! thy Juliet is alive,
le:    For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead;
le:    There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee,
le:    But thou slew'st Tybalt; there are thou happy too:
le:    The law that threaten'd death becomes thy friend
le:    And turns it to exile; there art thou happy:
le:    A pack of blessings lights up upon thy back;
le:    Happiness courts thee in her best array;
le:    But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench,
le:    Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love:
le:    Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
le:    Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed,
le:    Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her:
le:    But look thou stay not till the watch be set,
le:    For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;
le:    Where thou shalt live, till we can find a time
le:    To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
le:    Beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back
le:    With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
le:    Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.
le:    Go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady;
le:    And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
le:    Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto:
le:    Romeo is coming.
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night
le:    To hear good counsel: O, what learning is!
le:    My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir:
le:    Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.
le:
le:    Exit
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    How well my comfort is revived by this!
le:
le:FRIAR LAURENCE
le:
le:    Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:
le:    Either be gone before the watch be set,
le:    Or by the break of day disguised from hence:
le:    Sojourn in Mantua; I'll find out your man,
le:    And he shall signify from time to time
le:    Every good hap to you that chances here:
le:    Give me thy hand; 'tis late: farewell; good night.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
le:    It were a grief, so brief to part with thee: Farewell.
le:
le:    Exeunt
le:
le:SCENE IV. A room in Capulet's house.
le:
le:    Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and PARIS 
le:
le:CAPULET
le:
le:    Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily,
le:    That we have had no time to move our daughter:
le:    Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly,
le:    And so did I:--Well, we were born to die.
le:    'Tis very late, she'll not come down to-night:
le:    I promise you, but for your company,
le:    I would have been a-bed an hour ago.
le:
le:PARIS
le:
le:    These times of woe afford no time to woo.
le:    Madam, good night: commend me to your daughter.
le:
le:LADY CAPULET
le:
le:    I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;
le:    To-night she is mew'd up to her heaviness.
le:
le:CAPULET
le:
le:    Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender
le:    Of my child's love: I think she will be ruled
le:    In all respects by me; nay, more, I doubt it not.
le:    Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;
le:    Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love;
le:    And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next--
le:    But, soft! what day is this?
le:
le:PARIS
le:
le:    Monday, my lord,
le:
le:CAPULET
le:
le:    Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon,
le:    O' Thursday let it be: o' Thursday, tell her,
le:    She shall be married to this noble earl.
le:    Will you be ready? do you like this haste?
le:    We'll keep no great ado,--a friend or two;
le:    For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
le:    It may be thought we held him carelessly,
le:    Being our kinsman, if we revel much:
le:    Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,
le:    And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?
le:
le:PARIS
le:
le:    My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.
le:
le:CAPULET
le:
le:    Well get you gone: o' Thursday be it, then.
le:    Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,
le:    Prepare her, wife, against this wedding-day.
le:    Farewell, my lord. Light to my chamber, ho!
le:    Afore me! it is so very very late,
le:    That we may call it early by and by.
le:    Good night.
le:
le:    Exeunt
le:
le:SCENE V. Capulet's orchard.
le:
le:    Enter ROMEO and JULIET above, at the window 
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day:
le:    It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
le:    That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear;
le:    Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree:
le:    Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    It was the lark, the herald of the morn,
le:    No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks
le:    Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east:
le:    Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day
le:    Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
le:    I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    Yon light is not day-light, I know it, I:
le:    It is some meteor that the sun exhales,
le:    To be to thee this night a torch-bearer,
le:    And light thee on thy way to Mantua:
le:    Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death;
le:    I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
le:    I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,
le:    'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;
le:    Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat
le:    The vaulty heaven so high above our heads:
le:    I have more care to stay than will to go:
le:    Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.
le:    How is't, my soul? let's talk; it is not day.
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    It is, it is: hie hence, be gone, away!
le:    It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
le:    Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
le:    Some say the lark makes sweet division;
le:    This doth not so, for she divideth us:
le:    Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes,
le:    O, now I would they had changed voices too!
le:    Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
le:    Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day,
le:    O, now be gone; more light and light it grows.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    More light and light; more dark and dark our woes!
le:
le:    Enter Nurse, to the chamber
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    Madam!
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    Nurse?
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    Your lady mother is coming to your chamber:
le:    The day is broke; be wary, look about.
le:
le:    Exit
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    Then, window, let day in, and let life out.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Farewell, farewell! one kiss, and I'll descend.
le:
le:    He goeth down
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    Art thou gone so? love, lord, ay, husband, friend!
le:    I must hear from thee every day in the hour,
le:    For in a minute there are many days:
le:    O, by this count I shall be much in years
le:    Ere I again behold my Romeo!
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Farewell!
le:    I will omit no opportunity
le:    That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    O think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
le:    For sweet discourses in our time to come.
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    O God, I have an ill-divining soul!
le:    Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,
le:    As one dead in the bottom of a tomb:
le:    Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    And trust me, love, in my eye so do you:
le:    Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!
le:
le:    Exit
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    O fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle:
le:    If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him.
le:    That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, fortune;
le:    For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long,
le:    But send him back.
le:
le:LADY CAPULET
le:
le:    [Within] Ho, daughter! are you up?
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    Who is't that calls? is it my lady mother?
le:    Is she not down so late, or up so early?
le:    What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?
le:
le:    Enter LADY CAPULET
le:
le:LADY CAPULET
le:
le:    Why, how now, Juliet!
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    Madam, I am not well.
le:
le:LADY CAPULET
le:
le:    Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
le:    What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
le:    An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live;
le:    Therefore, have done: some grief shows much of love;
le:    But much of grief shows still some want of wit.
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.
le:
le:LADY CAPULET
le:
le:    So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
le:    Which you weep for.
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    Feeling so the loss,
le:    Cannot choose but ever weep the friend.
le:
le:LADY CAPULET
le:
le:    Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death,
le:    As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    What villain madam?
le:
le:LADY CAPULET
le:
le:    That same villain, Romeo.
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    [Aside] Villain and he be many miles asunder.--
le:    God Pardon him! I do, with all my heart;
le:    And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.
le:
le:LADY CAPULET
le:
le:    That is, because the traitor murderer lives.
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands:
le:    Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!
le:
le:LADY CAPULET
le:
le:    We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not:
le:    Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,
le:    Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,
le:    Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,
le:    That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:
le:    And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    Indeed, I never shall be satisfied
le:    With Romeo, till I behold him--dead--
le:    Is my poor heart for a kinsman vex'd.
le:    Madam, if you could find out but a man
le:    To bear a poison, I would temper it;
le:    That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,
le:    Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors
le:    To hear him named, and cannot come to him.
le:    To wreak the love I bore my cousin
le:    Upon his body that slaughter'd him!
le:
le:LADY CAPULET
le:
le:    Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.
le:    But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    And joy comes well in such a needy time:
le:    What are they, I beseech your ladyship?
le:
le:LADY CAPULET
le:
le:    Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;
le:    One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,
le:    Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,
le:    That thou expect'st not nor I look'd not for.
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    Madam, in happy time, what day is that?
le:
le:LADY CAPULET
le:
le:    Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn,
le:    The gallant, young and noble gentleman,
le:    The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,
le:    Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    Now, by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too,
le:    He shall not make me there a joyful bride.
le:    I wonder at this haste; that I must wed
le:    Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.
le:    I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,
le:    I will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear,
le:    It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
le:    Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!
le:
le:LADY CAPULET
le:
le:    Here comes your father; tell him so yourself,
le:    And see how he will take it at your hands.
le:
le:    Enter CAPULET and Nurse
le:
le:CAPULET
le:
le:    When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;
le:    But for the sunset of my brother's son
le:    It rains downright.
le:    How now! a conduit, girl? what, still in tears?
le:    Evermore showering? In one little body
le:    Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind;
le:    For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,
le:    Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,
le:    Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs;
le:    Who, raging with thy tears, and they with them,
le:    Without a sudden calm, will overset
le:    Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife!
le:    Have you deliver'd to her our decree?
le:
le:LADY CAPULET
le:
le:    Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.
le:    I would the fool were married to her grave!
le:
le:CAPULET
le:
le:    Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.
le:    How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks?
le:    Is she not proud? doth she not count her blest,
le:    Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
le:    So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    Not proud, you have; but thankful, that you have:
le:    Proud can I never be of what I hate;
le:    But thankful even for hate, that is meant love.
le:
le:CAPULET
le:
le:    How now, how now, chop-logic! What is this?
le:    'Proud,' and 'I thank you,' and 'I thank you not;'
le:    And yet 'not proud,' mistress minion, you,
le:    Thank me no thankings, nor, proud me no prouds,
le:    But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next,
le:    To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
le:    Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
le:    Out, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage!
le:    You tallow-face!
le:
le:LADY CAPULET
le:
le:    Fie, fie! what, are you mad?
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
le:    Hear me with patience but to speak a word.
le:
le:CAPULET
le:
le:    Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!
le:    I tell thee what: get thee to church o' Thursday,
le:    Or never after look me in the face:
le:    Speak not, reply not, do not answer me;
le:    My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest
le:    That God had lent us but this only child;
le:    But now I see this one is one too much,
le:    And that we have a curse in having her:
le:    Out on her, hilding!
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    God in heaven bless her!
le:    You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.
le:
le:CAPULET
le:
le:    And why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue,
le:    Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    I speak no treason.
le:
le:CAPULET
le:
le:    O, God ye god-den.
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    May not one speak?
le:
le:CAPULET
le:
le:    Peace, you mumbling fool!
le:    Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl;
le:    For here we need it not.
le:
le:LADY CAPULET
le:
le:    You are too hot.
le:
le:CAPULET
le:
le:    God's bread! it makes me mad:
le:    Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,
le:    Alone, in company, still my care hath been
le:    To have her match'd: and having now provided
le:    A gentleman of noble parentage,
le:    Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,
le:    Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
le:    Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man;
le:    And then to have a wretched puling fool,
le:    A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,
le:    To answer 'I'll not wed; I cannot love,
le:    I am too young; I pray you, pardon me.'
le:    But, as you will not wed, I'll pardon you:
le:    Graze where you will you shall not house with me:
le:    Look to't, think on't, I do not use to jest.
le:    Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:
le:    An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;
le:    And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in
le:    the streets,
le:    For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,
le:    Nor what is mine shall never do thee good:
le:    Trust to't, bethink you; I'll not be forsworn.
le:
le:    Exit
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,
le:    That sees into the bottom of my grief?
le:    O, sweet my mother, cast me not away!
le:    Delay this marriage for a month, a week;
le:    Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed
le:    In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.
le:
le:LADY CAPULET
le:
le:    Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word:
le:    Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.
le:
le:    Exit
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    O God!--O nurse, how shall this be prevented?
le:    My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven;
le:    How shall that faith return again to earth,
le:    Unless that husband send it me from heaven
le:    By leaving earth? comfort me, counsel me.
le:    Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems
le:    Upon so soft a subject as myself!
le:    What say'st thou? hast thou not a word of joy?
le:    Some comfort, nurse.
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    Faith, here it is.
le:    Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing,
le:    That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;
le:    Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
le:    Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
le:    I think it best you married with the county.
le:    O, he's a lovely gentleman!
le:    Romeo's a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam,
le:    Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
le:    As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,
le:    I think you are happy in this second match,
le:    For it excels your first: or if it did not,
le:    Your first is dead; or 'twere as good he were,
le:    As living here and you no use of him.
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    Speakest thou from thy heart?
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    And from my soul too;
le:    Or else beshrew them both.
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    Amen!
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    What?
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.
le:    Go in: and tell my lady I am gone,
le:    Having displeased my father, to Laurence' cell,
le:    To make confession and to be absolved.
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.
le:
le:    Exit
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!
le:    Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,
le:    Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
le:    Which she hath praised him with above compare
le:    So many thousand times? Go, counsellor;
le:    Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.
le:    I'll to the friar, to know his remedy:
le:    If all else fail, myself have power to die.
le:
le:    Exit
le:
le:ACT IV
le:SCENE I. Friar Laurence's cell.
le:
le:    Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and PARIS 
le:
le:FRIAR LAURENCE
le:
le:    On Thursday, sir? the time is very short.
le:
le:PARIS
le:
le:    My father Capulet will have it so;
le:    And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.
le:
le:FRIAR LAURENCE
le:
le:    You say you do not know the lady's mind:
le:    Uneven is the course, I like it not.
le:
le:PARIS
le:
le:    Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
le:    And therefore have I little talk'd of love;
le:    For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
le:    Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
le:    That she doth give her sorrow so much sway,
le:    And in his wisdom hastes our marriage,
le:    To stop the inundation of her tears;
le:    Which, too much minded by herself alone,
le:    May be put from her by society:
le:    Now do you know the reason of this haste.
le:
le:FRIAR LAURENCE
le:
le:    [Aside] I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.
le:    Look, sir, here comes the lady towards my cell.
le:
le:    Enter JULIET
le:
le:PARIS
le:
le:    Happily met, my lady and my wife!
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.
le:
le:PARIS
le:
le:    That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    What must be shall be.
le:
le:FRIAR LAURENCE
le:
le:    That's a certain text.
le:
le:PARIS
le:
le:    Come you to make confession to this father?
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    To answer that, I should confess to you.
le:
le:PARIS
le:
le:    Do not deny to him that you love me.
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    I will confess to you that I love him.
le:
le:PARIS
le:
le:    So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    If I do so, it will be of more price,
le:    Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.
le:
le:PARIS
le:
le:    Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    The tears have got small victory by that;
le:    For it was bad enough before their spite.
le:
le:PARIS
le:
le:    Thou wrong'st it, more than tears, with that report.
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;
le:    And what I spake, I spake it to my face.
le:
le:PARIS
le:
le:    Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander'd it.
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    It may be so, for it is not mine own.
le:    Are you at leisure, holy father, now;
le:    Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
le:
le:FRIAR LAURENCE
le:
le:    My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.
le:    My lord, we must entreat the time alone.
le:
le:PARIS
le:
le:    God shield I should disturb devotion!
le:    Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye:
le:    Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.
le:
le:    Exit
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    O shut the door! and when thou hast done so,
le:    Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!
le:
le:FRIAR LAURENCE
le:
le:    Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;
le:    It strains me past the compass of my wits:
le:    I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
le:    On Thursday next be married to this county.
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,
le:    Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:
le:    If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,
le:    Do thou but call my resolution wise,
le:    And with this knife I'll help it presently.
le:    God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;
le:    And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd,
le:    Shall be the label to another deed,
le:    Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
le:    Turn to another, this shall slay them both:
le:    Therefore, out of thy long-experienced time,
le:    Give me some present counsel, or, behold,
le:    'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
le:    Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that
le:    Which the commission of thy years and art
le:    Could to no issue of true honour bring.
le:    Be not so long to speak; I long to die,
le:    If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.
le:
le:FRIAR LAURENCE
le:
le:    Hold, daughter: I do spy a kind of hope,
le:    Which craves as desperate an execution.
le:    As that is desperate which we would prevent.
le:    If, rather than to marry County Paris,
le:    Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
le:    Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
le:    A thing like death to chide away this shame,
le:    That copest with death himself to scape from it:
le:    And, if thou darest, I'll give thee remedy.
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
le:    From off the battlements of yonder tower;
le:    Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
le:    Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;
le:    Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,
le:    O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,
le:    With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;
le:    Or bid me go into a new-made grave
le:    And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;
le:    Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;
le:    And I will do it without fear or doubt,
le:    To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.
le:
le:FRIAR LAURENCE
le:
le:    Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent
le:    To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow:
le:    To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;
le:    Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:
le:    Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
le:    And this distilled liquor drink thou off;
le:    When presently through all thy veins shall run
le:    A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse
le:    Shall keep his native progress, but surcease:
le:    No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;
le:    The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
le:    To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall,
le:    Like death, when he shuts up the day of life;
le:    Each part, deprived of supple government,
le:    Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death:
le:    And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death
le:    Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,
le:    And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
le:    Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes
le:    To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:
le:    Then, as the manner of our country is,
le:    In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier
le:    Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
le:    Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
le:    In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,
le:    Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,
le:    And hither shall he come: and he and I
le:    Will watch thy waking, and that very night
le:    Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
le:    And this shall free thee from this present shame;
le:    If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear,
le:    Abate thy valour in the acting it.
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!
le:
le:FRIAR LAURENCE
le:
le:    Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous
le:    In this resolve: I'll send a friar with speed
le:    To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.
le:    Farewell, dear father!
le:
le:    Exeunt
le:
le:SCENE II. Hall in Capulet's house.
le:
le:    Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, Nurse, and two Servingmen 
le:
le:CAPULET
le:
le:    So many guests invite as here are writ.
le:
le:    Exit First Servant
le:    Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.
le:
le:Second Servant
le:
le:    You shall have none ill, sir; for I'll try if they
le:    can lick their fingers.
le:
le:CAPULET
le:
le:    How canst thou try them so?
le:
le:Second Servant
le:
le:    Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his
le:    own fingers: therefore he that cannot lick his
le:    fingers goes not with me.
le:
le:CAPULET
le:
le:    Go, be gone.
le:
le:    Exit Second Servant
le:    We shall be much unfurnished for this time.
le:    What, is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence?
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    Ay, forsooth.
le:
le:CAPULET
le:
le:    Well, he may chance to do some good on her:
le:    A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    See where she comes from shrift with merry look.
le:
le:    Enter JULIET
le:
le:CAPULET
le:
le:    How now, my headstrong! where have you been gadding?
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    Where I have learn'd me to repent the sin
le:    Of disobedient opposition
le:    To you and your behests, and am enjoin'd
le:    By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here,
le:    And beg your pardon: pardon, I beseech you!
le:    Henceforward I am ever ruled by you.
le:
le:CAPULET
le:
le:    Send for the county; go tell him of this:
le:    I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell;
le:    And gave him what becomed love I might,
le:    Not step o'er the bounds of modesty.
le:
le:CAPULET
le:
le:    Why, I am glad on't; this is well: stand up:
le:    This is as't should be. Let me see the county;
le:    Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.
le:    Now, afore God! this reverend holy friar,
le:    Our whole city is much bound to him.
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    Nurse, will you go with me into my closet,
le:    To help me sort such needful ornaments
le:    As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?
le:
le:LADY CAPULET
le:
le:    No, not till Thursday; there is time enough.
le:
le:CAPULET
le:
le:    Go, nurse, go with her: we'll to church to-morrow.
le:
le:    Exeunt JULIET and Nurse
le:
le:LADY CAPULET
le:
le:    We shall be short in our provision:
le:    'Tis now near night.
le:
le:CAPULET
le:
le:    Tush, I will stir about,
le:    And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife:
le:    Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her;
le:    I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone;
le:    I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho!
le:    They are all forth. Well, I will walk myself
le:    To County Paris, to prepare him up
le:    Against to-morrow: my heart is wondrous light,
le:    Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.
le:
le:    Exeunt
le:
le:SCENE III. Juliet's chamber.
le:
le:    Enter JULIET and Nurse 
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    Ay, those attires are best: but, gentle nurse,
le:    I pray thee, leave me to my self to-night,
le:    For I have need of many orisons
le:    To move the heavens to smile upon my state,
le:    Which, well thou know'st, is cross, and full of sin.
le:
le:    Enter LADY CAPULET
le:
le:LADY CAPULET
le:
le:    What, are you busy, ho? need you my help?
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries
le:    As are behoveful for our state to-morrow:
le:    So please you, let me now be left alone,
le:    And let the nurse this night sit up with you;
le:    For, I am sure, you have your hands full all,
le:    In this so sudden business.
le:
le:LADY CAPULET
le:
le:    Good night:
le:    Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.
le:
le:    Exeunt LADY CAPULET and Nurse
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.
le:    I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins,
le:    That almost freezes up the heat of life:
le:    I'll call them back again to comfort me:
le:    Nurse! What should she do here?
le:    My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
le:    Come, vial.
le:    What if this mixture do not work at all?
le:    Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?
le:    No, no: this shall forbid it: lie thou there.
le:
le:    Laying down her dagger
le:    What if it be a poison, which the friar
le:    Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead,
le:    Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd,
le:    Because he married me before to Romeo?
le:    I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not,
le:    For he hath still been tried a holy man.
le:    How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
le:    I wake before the time that Romeo
le:    Come to redeem me? there's a fearful point!
le:    Shall I not, then, be stifled in the vault,
le:    To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
le:    And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
le:    Or, if I live, is it not very like,
le:    The horrible conceit of death and night,
le:    Together with the terror of the place,--
le:    As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,
le:    Where, for these many hundred years, the bones
le:    Of all my buried ancestors are packed:
le:    Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
le:    Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,
le:    At some hours in the night spirits resort;--
le:    Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
le:    So early waking, what with loathsome smells,
le:    And shrieks like mandrakes' torn out of the earth,
le:    That living mortals, hearing them, run mad:--
le:    O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
le:    Environed with all these hideous fears?
le:    And madly play with my forefather's joints?
le:    And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?
le:    And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone,
le:    As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?
le:    O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost
le:    Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body
le:    Upon a rapier's point: stay, Tybalt, stay!
le:    Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.
le:
le:    She falls upon her bed, within the curtains
le:
le:SCENE IV. Hall in Capulet's house.

le:    Enter LADY CAPULET and Nurse 
le:
le:LADY CAPULET

le:    Hold, take these keys, and fetch more spices, nurse.
le:

le:
le:    Enter CAPULET
le:
le:CAPULET
le:
le:    Come, stir, stir, stir! the second cock hath crow'd,
le:    The curfew-bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock:
le:    Look to the baked meats, good Angelica:
le:    Spare not for the cost.
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    Go, you cot-quean, go,
le:    Get you to bed; faith, You'll be sick to-morrow
le:    For this night's watching.
le:
le:CAPULET
le:
le:    No, not a whit: what! I have watch'd ere now
le:    All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.
le:
le:LADY CAPULET
le:
le:    Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;
le:    But I will watch you from such watching now.
le:
le:    Exeunt LADY CAPULET and Nurse
le:
le:CAPULET
le:
le:    A jealous hood, a jealous hood!
le:
le:    Enter three or four Servingmen, with spits, logs, and baskets
le:    Now, fellow,
le:    What's there?
le:
le:First Servant
le:
le:    Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what.
le:
le:CAPULET
le:
le:    Make haste, make haste.
le:
le:    Exit First Servant
le:    Sirrah, fetch drier logs:
le:    Call Peter, he will show thee where they are.
le:
le:Second Servant
le:
le:    I have a head, sir, that will find out logs,
le:    And never trouble Peter for the matter.
le:
le:    Exit
le:
le:CAPULET
le:
le:    Mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha!
le:    Thou shalt be logger-head. Good faith, 'tis day:
le:    The county will be here with music straight,
le:    For so he said he would: I hear him near.
le:
le:    Music within
le:    Nurse! Wife! What, ho! What, nurse, I say!
le:
le:    Re-enter Nurse
le:    Go waken Juliet, go and trim her up;
le:    I'll go and chat with Paris: hie, make haste,
le:    Make haste; the bridegroom he is come already:
le:    Make haste, I say.
le:
le:    Exeunt
le:
le:SCENE V. Juliet's chamber.
le:

le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    Mistress! what, mistress! Juliet! fast, I warrant her, she:
le:    Why, lamb! why, lady! fie, you slug-a-bed!
le:    Why, love, I say! madam! sweet-heart! why, bride!
le:    What, not a word? you take your pennyworths now;
le:    Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,
le:    The County Paris hath set up his rest,
le:    That you shall rest but little. God forgive me,
le:    Marry, and amen, how sound is she asleep!
le:    I must needs wake her. Madam, madam, madam!
le:    Ay, let the county take you in your bed;
le:    He'll fright you up, i' faith. Will it not be?
le:
le:    Undraws the curtains
le:    What, dress'd! and in your clothes! and down again!
le:    I must needs wake you; Lady! lady! lady!
le:    Alas, alas! Help, help! my lady's dead!
le:    O, well-a-day, that ever I was born!
le:    Some aqua vitae, ho! My lord! my lady!

le:
le:    For shame, bring Juliet forth; her lord is come.
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    She's dead, deceased, she's dead; alack the day!
le:
le:LADY CAPULET
le:
le:    Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!
le:
le:CAPULET
le:
le:    Ha! let me see her: out, alas! she's cold:
le:    Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;
le:    Life and these lips have long been separated:
le:    Death lies on her like an untimely frost
le:    Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    O lamentable day!
le:
le:LADY CAPULET
le:
le:    O woful time!
le:
le:CAPULET
le:
le:    Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,
le:    Ties up my tongue, and will not let me speak.
le:
le:    Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and PARIS, with Musicians
le:
le:FRIAR LAURENCE
le:
le:    Come, is the bride ready to go to church?
le:
le:CAPULET
le:
le:    Ready to go, but never to return.
le:    O son! the night before thy wedding-day
le:    Hath Death lain with thy wife. There she lies,
le:    Flower as she was, deflowered by him.
le:    Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir;
le:    My daughter he hath wedded: I will die,
le:    And leave him all; life, living, all is Death's.
le:
le:PARIS
le:
le:    Have I thought long to see this morning's face,
le:    And doth it give me such a sight as this?
le:
le:LADY CAPULET
le:
le:    Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
le:    Most miserable hour that e'er time saw
le:    In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!
le:    But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
le:    But one thing to rejoice and solace in,
le:    And cruel death hath catch'd it from my sight!
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    O woe! O woful, woful, woful day!
le:    Most lamentable day, most woful day,
le:    That ever, ever, I did yet behold!
le:    O day! O day! O day! O hateful day!
le:    Never was seen so black a day as this:
le:    O woful day, O woful day!
le:
le:PARIS
le:
le:    Beguiled, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!
le:    Most detestable death, by thee beguil'd,
le:    By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown!
le:    O love! O life! not life, but love in death!
le:
le:CAPULET
le:
le:    Despised, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!
le:    Uncomfortable time, why camest thou now
le:    To murder, murder our solemnity?
le:    O child! O child! my soul, and not my child!
le:    Dead art thou! Alack! my child is dead;
le:    And with my child my joys are buried.
le:
le:FRIAR LAURENCE
le:
le:    Peace, ho, for shame! confusion's cure lives not
le:    In these confusions. Heaven and yourself
le:    Had part in this fair maid; now heaven hath all,
le:    And all the better is it for the maid:
le:    Your part in her you could not keep from death,
le:    But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
le:    The most you sought was her promotion;
le:    For 'twas your heaven she should be advanced:
le:    And weep ye now, seeing she is advanced
le:    Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
le:    O, in this love, you love your child so ill,
le:    That you run mad, seeing that she is well:
le:    She's not well married that lives married long;
le:    But she's best married that dies married young.
le:    Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary
le:    On this fair corse; and, as the custom is,
le:    In all her best array bear her to church:
le:    For though fond nature bids us an lament,
le:    Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.
le:
le:CAPULET
le:
le:    All things that we ordained festival,
le:    Turn from their office to black funeral;
le:    Our instruments to melancholy bells,
le:    Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast,
le:    Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change,
le:    Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,
le:    And all things change them to the contrary.
le:
le:FRIAR LAURENCE
le:
le:    Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him;
le:    And go, Sir Paris; every one prepare
le:    To follow this fair corse unto her grave:
le:    The heavens do lour upon you for some ill;
le:    Move them no more by crossing their high will.
le:
le:    Exeunt CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, PARIS, and FRIAR LAURENCE
le:
le:First Musician
le:
le:    Faith, we may put up our pipes, and be gone.
le:
le:Nurse
le:
le:    Honest goodfellows, ah, put up, put up;
le:    For, well you know, this is a pitiful case.
le:
le:    Exit
le:
le:First Musician
le:
le:    Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.
le:
le:    Enter PETER
le:
le:PETER
le:
le:    Musicians, O, musicians, 'Heart's ease, Heart's
le:    ease:' O, an you will have me live, play 'Heart's ease.'
le:
le:First Musician
le:
le:    Why 'Heart's ease?'
le:
le:PETER
le:
le:    O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My
le:    heart is full of woe:' O, play me some merry dump,
le:    to comfort me.
le:
le:First Musician
le:
le:    Not a dump we; 'tis no time to play now.
le:
le:PETER
le:
le:    You will not, then?
le:
le:First Musician
le:
le:    No.
le:
le:PETER
le:
le:    I will then give it you soundly.
le:
le:First Musician
le:
le:    What will you give us?
le:
le:PETER
le:
le:    No money, on my faith, but the gleek;
le:    I will give you the minstrel.
le:
le:First Musician
le:
le:    Then I will give you the serving-creature.
le:
le:PETER
le:
le:    Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on
le:    your pate. I will carry no crotchets: I'll re you,
le:    I'll fa you; do you note me?
le:
le:First Musician
le:
le:    An you re us and fa us, you note us.
le:
le:Second Musician
le:
le:    Pray you, put up your dagger, and put out your wit.
le:
le:PETER
le:
le:    Then have at you with my wit! I will dry-beat you
le:    with an iron wit, and put up my iron dagger. Answer
le:    me like men:
le:    'When griping grief the heart doth wound,
le:    And doleful dumps the mind oppress,
le:    Then music with her silver sound'--
le:    why 'silver sound'? why 'music with her silver
le:    sound'? What say you, Simon Catling?
le:
le:Musician
le:
le:    Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.
le:
le:PETER
le:
le:    Pretty! What say you, Hugh Rebeck?
le:
le:Second Musician
le:
le:    I say 'silver sound,' because musicians sound for silver.
le:
le:PETER
le:
le:    Pretty too! What say you, James Soundpost?
le:
le:Third Musician
le:
le:    Faith, I know not what to say.
le:
le:PETER
le:
le:    O, I cry you mercy; you are the singer: I will say
le:    for you. It is 'music with her silver sound,'
le:    because musicians have no gold for sounding:
le:    'Then music with her silver sound
le:    With speedy help doth lend redress.'
le:
le:    Exit
le:
le:First Musician
le:
le:    What a pestilent knave is this same!
le:
le:Second Musician
le:
le:    Hang him, Jack! Come, we'll in here; tarry for the
le:    mourners, and stay dinner.
le:
le:    Exeunt
le:
le:ACT V
le:SCENE I. Mantua. A street.
le:
le:    Enter ROMEO 
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep,
le:    My dreams presage some joyful news at hand:
le:    My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne;
le:    And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit
le:    Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
le:    I dreamt my lady came and found me dead--
le:    Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave
le:    to think!--
le:    And breathed such life with kisses in my lips,
le:    That I revived, and was an emperor.
le:    Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,
le:    When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!
le:
le:    Enter BALTHASAR, booted
le:    News from Verona!--How now, Balthasar!
le:    Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?
le:    How doth my lady? Is my father well?
le:    How fares my Juliet? that I ask again;
le:    For nothing can be ill, if she be well.
le:
le:BALTHASAR
le:
le:    Then she is well, and nothing can be ill:
le:    Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,
le:    And her immortal part with angels lives.
le:    I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault,
le:    And presently took post to tell it you:
le:    O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,
le:    Since you did leave it for my office, sir.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Is it even so? then I defy you, stars!
le:    Thou know'st my lodging: get me ink and paper,
le:    And hire post-horses; I will hence to-night.
le:
le:BALTHASAR
le:
le:    I do beseech you, sir, have patience:
le:    Your looks are pale and wild, and do import
le:    Some misadventure.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Tush, thou art deceived:
le:    Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.
le:    Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?
le:
le:BALTHASAR
le:
le:    No, my good lord.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    No matter: get thee gone,
le:    And hire those horses; I'll be with thee straight.
le:
le:    Exit BALTHASAR
le:    Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.
le:    Let's see for means: O mischief, thou art swift
le:    To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!
le:    I do remember an apothecary,--
le:    And hereabouts he dwells,--which late I noted
le:    In tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows,
le:    Culling of simples; meagre were his looks,
le:    Sharp misery had worn him to the bones:
le:    And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
le:    An alligator stuff'd, and other skins
le:    Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
le:    A beggarly account of empty boxes,
le:    Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds,
le:    Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses,
le:    Were thinly scatter'd, to make up a show.
le:    Noting this penury, to myself I said
le:    'An if a man did need a poison now,
le:    Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
le:    Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'
le:    O, this same thought did but forerun my need;
le:    And this same needy man must sell it me.
le:    As I remember, this should be the house.
le:    Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut.
le:    What, ho! apothecary!
le:
le:    Enter Apothecary
le:
le:Apothecary
le:
le:    Who calls so loud?
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor:
le:    Hold, there is forty ducats: let me have
le:    A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
le:    As will disperse itself through all the veins
le:    That the life-weary taker may fall dead
le:    And that the trunk may be discharged of breath
le:    As violently as hasty powder fired
le:    Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.
le:
le:Apothecary
le:
le:    Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law
le:    Is death to any he that utters them.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,
le:    And fear'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks,
le:    Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,
le:    Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back;
le:    The world is not thy friend nor the world's law;
le:    The world affords no law to make thee rich;
le:    Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
le:
le:Apothecary
le:
le:    My poverty, but not my will, consents.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
le:
le:Apothecary
le:
le:    Put this in any liquid thing you will,
le:    And drink it off; and, if you had the strength
le:    Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    There is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls,
le:    Doing more murders in this loathsome world,
le:    Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.
le:    I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.
le:    Farewell: buy food, and get thyself in flesh.
le:    Come, cordial and not poison, go with me
le:    To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.
le:
le:    Exeunt
le:
le:SCENE II. Friar Laurence's cell.
le:
le:    Enter FRIAR JOHN 
le:
le:FRIAR JOHN
le:
le:    Holy Franciscan friar! brother, ho!
le:
le:    Enter FRIAR LAURENCE
le:
le:FRIAR LAURENCE
le:
le:    This same should be the voice of Friar John.
le:    Welcome from Mantua: what says Romeo?
le:    Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.
le:
le:FRIAR JOHN
le:
le:    Going to find a bare-foot brother out
le:    One of our order, to associate me,
le:    Here in this city visiting the sick,
le:    And finding him, the searchers of the town,
le:    Suspecting that we both were in a house
le:    Where the infectious pestilence did reign,
le:    Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth;
le:    So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.
le:
le:FRIAR LAURENCE
le:
le:    Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?
le:
le:FRIAR JOHN
le:
le:    I could not send it,--here it is again,--
le:    Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,
le:    So fearful were they of infection.
le:
le:FRIAR LAURENCE
le:
le:    Unhappy fortune! by my brotherhood,
le:    The letter was not nice but full of charge
le:    Of dear import, and the neglecting it
le:    May do much danger. Friar John, go hence;
le:    Get me an iron crow, and bring it straight
le:    Unto my cell.
le:
le:FRIAR JOHN
le:
le:    Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.
le:
le:    Exit
le:
le:FRIAR LAURENCE
le:
le:    Now must I to the monument alone;
le:    Within three hours will fair Juliet wake:
le:    She will beshrew me much that Romeo
le:    Hath had no notice of these accidents;
le:    But I will write again to Mantua,
le:    And keep her at my cell till Romeo come;
le:    Poor living corse, closed in a dead man's tomb!
le:
le:    Exit
le:
le:SCENE III. A churchyard; in it a tomb belonging to the Capulets.
le:
le:    Enter PARIS, and his Page bearing flowers and a torch 
le:
le:PARIS
le:
le:    Give me thy torch, boy: hence, and stand aloof:
le:    Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.
le:    Under yond yew-trees lay thee all along,
le:    Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground;
le:    So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,
le:    Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,
le:    But thou shalt hear it: whistle then to me,
le:    As signal that thou hear'st something approach.
le:    Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.
le:
le:PAGE
le:
le:    [Aside] I am almost afraid to stand alone
le:    Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.
le:
le:    Retires
le:
le:PARIS
le:
le:    Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew,--
le:    O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones;--
le:    Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,
le:    Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans:
le:    The obsequies that I for thee will keep
le:    Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.
le:
le:    The Page whistles
le:    The boy gives warning something doth approach.
le:    What cursed foot wanders this way to-night,
le:    To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?
le:    What with a torch! muffle me, night, awhile.
le:
le:    Retires
le:
le:    Enter ROMEO and BALTHASAR, with a torch, mattock, & c
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
le:    Hold, take this letter; early in the morning
le:    See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
le:    Give me the light: upon thy life, I charge thee,
le:    Whate'er thou hear'st or seest, stand all aloof,
le:    And do not interrupt me in my course.
le:    Why I descend into this bed of death,
le:    Is partly to behold my lady's face;
le:    But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
le:    A precious ring, a ring that I must use
le:    In dear employment: therefore hence, be gone:
le:    But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry
le:    In what I further shall intend to do,
le:    By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint
le:    And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs:
le:    The time and my intents are savage-wild,
le:    More fierce and more inexorable far
le:    Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.
le:
le:BALTHASAR
le:
le:    I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that:
le:    Live, and be prosperous: and farewell, good fellow.
le:
le:BALTHASAR
le:
le:    [Aside] For all this same, I'll hide me hereabout:
le:    His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.
le:
le:    Retires
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
le:    Gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth,
le:    Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,
le:    And, in despite, I'll cram thee with more food!
le:
le:    Opens the tomb
le:
le:PARIS
le:
le:    This is that banish'd haughty Montague,
le:    That murder'd my love's cousin, with which grief,
le:    It is supposed, the fair creature died;
le:    And here is come to do some villanous shame
le:    To the dead bodies: I will apprehend him.
le:
le:    Comes forward
le:    Stop thy unhallow'd toil, vile Montague!
le:    Can vengeance be pursued further than death?
le:    Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee:
le:    Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.
le:    Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man;
le:    Fly hence, and leave me: think upon these gone;
le:    Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,
le:    Put not another sin upon my head,
le:    By urging me to fury: O, be gone!
le:    By heaven, I love thee better than myself;
le:    For I come hither arm'd against myself:
le:    Stay not, be gone; live, and hereafter say,
le:    A madman's mercy bade thee run away.
le:
le:PARIS
le:
le:    I do defy thy conjurations,
le:    And apprehend thee for a felon here.
le:

le:
le:    Wilt thou provoke me? then have at thee, boy!

le:
le:    O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.
le:

le:
le:PARIS
le:
le:    O, I am slain!
le:
le:    Falls
le:    If thou be merciful,
le:    Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.
le:
le:    Dies
le:
le:ROMEO
le:
le:    In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.
le:    Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!
le:    What said my man, when my betossed soul
le:    Did not attend him as we rode? I think
le:    He told me Paris should have married Juliet:
le:    Said he not so? or did I dream it so?
le:    Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,
le:    To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,
le:    One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!
le:    I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave;
le:    A grave? O no! a lantern, slaughter'd youth,
le:    For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
le:    This vault a feasting presence full of light.
le:    Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.
le:
le:    Laying PARIS in the tomb
le:    How oft when men are at the point of death
le:    Have they been merry! which their keepers call
le:    A lightning before death: O, how may I
le:    Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!
le:    Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,
le:    Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:
le:    Thou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yet
le:    Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
le:    And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
le:    Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
le:    O, what more favour can I do to thee,
le:    Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
le:    To sunder his that was thine enemy?
le:    Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet,
le:    Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe
le:    That unsubstantial death is amorous,
le:    And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
le:    Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
le:    For fear of that, I still will stay with thee;
le:    And never from this palace of dim night
le:    Depart again: here, here will I remain
le:    With worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, here
le:    Will I set up my everlasting rest,
le:    And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
le:    From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
le:    Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you
le:    The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
le:    A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
le:    Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!
le:    Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
le:    The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!
le:    Here's to my love!
le:
le:    Drinks
le:    O true apothecary!
le:    Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.
le:

le:
le:    Enter, at the other end of the churchyard, FRIAR LAURENCE, with a lantern, crow, and spade
le:
le:FRIAR LAURENCE
le:
le:    Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night
le:    Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there?
le:
le:BALTHASAR
le:
le:    Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.
le:
le:FRIAR LAURENCE
le:
le:    Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,
le:    What torch is yond, that vainly lends his light
le:    To grubs and eyeless skulls? as I discern,
le:    It burneth in the Capel's monument.
le:
le:BALTHASAR
le:
le:    It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,
le:    One that you love.
le:
le:FRIAR LAURENCE
le:
le:    Who is it?
le:
le:BALTHASAR
le:
le:    Romeo.
le:
le:FRIAR LAURENCE
le:
le:    How long hath he been there?
le:
le:BALTHASAR
le:
le:    Full half an hour.
le:
le:FRIAR LAURENCE
le:
le:    Go with me to the vault.
le:
le:BALTHASAR
le:
le:    I dare not, sir
le:    My master knows not but I am gone hence;
le:    And fearfully did menace me with death,
le:    If I did stay to look on his intents.
le:
le:FRIAR LAURENCE
le:
le:    Stay, then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me:
le:    O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing.
le:
le:BALTHASAR
le:
le:    As I did sleep under this yew-tree here,
le:    I dreamt my master and another fought,
le:    And that my master slew him.
le:
le:FRIAR LAURENCE
le:
le:    Romeo!
le:
le:    Advances
le:    Alack, alack, what blood is this, which stains
le:    The stony entrance of this sepulchre?
le:    What mean these masterless and gory swords
le:    To lie discolour'd by this place of peace?
le:
le:    Enters the tomb
le:    Romeo! O, pale! Who else? what, Paris too?
le:    And steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour
le:    Is guilty of this lamentable chance!
le:    The lady stirs.
le:
le:    JULIET wakes
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    O comfortable friar! where is my lord?
le:    I do remember well where I should be,
le:    And there I am. Where is my Romeo?
le:
le:    Noise within
le:
le:FRIAR LAURENCE
le:
le:    I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest
le:    Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep:
le:    A greater power than we can contradict
le:    Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.
le:    Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;
le:    And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee
le:    Among a sisterhood of holy nuns:
le:    Stay not to question, for the watch is coming;
le:    Come, go, good Juliet,
le:
le:    Noise again
le:    I dare no longer stay.
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.
le:
le:    Exit FRIAR LAURENCE
le:    What's here? a cup, closed in my true love's hand?
le:    Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end:
le:    O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop
le:    To help me after? I will kiss thy lips;
le:    Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,
le:    To make die with a restorative.
le:
le:    Kisses him
le:    Thy lips are warm.
le:
le:First Watchman
le:
le:    [Within] Lead, boy: which way?
le:
le:JULIET
le:
le:    Yea, noise? then I'll be brief. O happy dagger!
le:
le:    Snatching ROMEO's dagger
le:    This is thy sheath;
le:
le:    Stabs herself
le:    there rust, and let me die.
le:
le:    Falls on ROMEO's body, and dies
le:
le:    Enter Watch, with the Page of PARIS
le:
le:PAGE
le:
le:    This is the place; there, where the torch doth burn.
le:
le:First Watchman
le:
le:    The ground is bloody; search about the churchyard:
le:    Go, some of you, whoe'er you find attach.
le:    Pitiful sight! here lies the county slain,
le:    And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
le:    Who here hath lain these two days buried.
le:    Go, tell the prince: run to the Capulets:
le:    Raise up the Montagues: some others search:
le:    We see the ground whereon these woes do lie;
le:    But the true ground of all these piteous woes
le:    We cannot without circumstance descry.
le:
le:    Re-enter some of the Watch, with BALTHASAR
le:
le:Second Watchman
le:
le:    Here's Romeo's man; we found him in the churchyard.
le:
le:First Watchman
le:
le:    Hold him in safety, till the prince come hither.
le:
le:    Re-enter others of the Watch, with FRIAR LAURENCE
le:
le:Third Watchman
le:
le:    Here is a friar, that trembles, sighs and weeps:
le:    We took this mattock and this spade from him,
le:    As he was coming from this churchyard side.
le:
le:First Watchman
le:
le:    A great suspicion: stay the friar too.
le:
le:    Enter the PRINCE and Attendants
le:
le:PRINCE
le:
le:    What misadventure is so early up,
le:    That calls our person from our morning's rest?
le:
le:    Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and others
le:
le:CAPULET
le:
le:    What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?
le:
le:LADY CAPULET
le:
le:    The people in the street cry Romeo,
le:    Some Juliet, and some Paris; and all run,
le:    With open outcry toward our monument.
le:
le:PRINCE
le:
le:    What fear is this which startles in our ears?
le:
le:First Watchman
le:
le:    Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;
le:    And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,
le:    Warm and new kill'd.
le:
le:PRINCE
le:
le:    Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.
le:
le:First Watchman
le:
le:    Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man;
le:    With instruments upon them, fit to open
le:    These dead men's tombs.
le:
le:CAPULET
le:
le:    O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
le:    This dagger hath mista'en--for, lo, his house
le:    Is empty on the back of Montague,--
le:    And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom!
le:
le:LADY CAPULET
le:
le:    O me! this sight of death is as a bell,
le:    That warns my old age to a sepulchre.
le:
le:    Enter MONTAGUE and others
le:
le:PRINCE
le:
le:    Come, Montague; for thou art early up,
le:    To see thy son and heir more early down.
le:
le:MONTAGUE
le:
le:    Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night;
le:    Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath:
le:    What further woe conspires against mine age?
le:
le:PRINCE
le:
le:    Look, and thou shalt see.
le:
le:MONTAGUE
le:
le:    O thou untaught! what manners is in this?
le:    To press before thy father to a grave?
le:
le:PRINCE
le:
le:    Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,
le:    Till we can clear these ambiguities,
le:    And know their spring, their head, their
le:    true descent;
le:    And then will I be general of your woes,
le:    And lead you even to death: meantime forbear,
le:    And let mischance be slave to patience.
le:    Bring forth the parties of suspicion.
le:
le:FRIAR LAURENCE
le:
le:    I am the greatest, able to do least,
le:    Yet most suspected, as the time and place
le:    Doth make against me of this direful murder;
le:    And here I stand, both to impeach and purge
le:    Myself condemned and myself excused.
le:
le:PRINCE
le:
le:    Then say at once what thou dost know in this.
le:
le:FRIAR LAURENCE
le:
le:    I will be brief, for my short date of breath
le:    Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
le:    Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;
le:    And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife:
le:    I married them; and their stol'n marriage-day
le:    Was Tybalt's dooms-day, whose untimely death
le:    Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from the city,
le:    For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.
le:    You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
le:    Betroth'd and would have married her perforce
le:    To County Paris: then comes she to me,
le:    And, with wild looks, bid me devise some mean
le:    To rid her from this second marriage,
le:    Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
le:    Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art,
le:    A sleeping potion; which so took effect
le:    As I intended, for it wrought on her
le:    The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,
le:    That he should hither come as this dire night,
le:    To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,
le:    Being the time the potion's force should cease.
le:    But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
le:    Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight
le:    Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
le:    At the prefixed hour of her waking,
le:    Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;
le:    Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,
le:    Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:
le:    But when I came, some minute ere the time
le:    Of her awaking, here untimely lay
le:    The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
le:    She wakes; and I entreated her come forth,
le:    And bear this work of heaven with patience:
le:    But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;
le:    And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
le:    But, as it seems, did violence on herself.
le:    All this I know; and to the marriage
le:    Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this
le:    Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
le:    Be sacrificed, some hour before his time,
le:    Unto the rigour of severest law.
le:
le:PRINCE
le:
le:    We still have known thee for a holy man.
le:    Where's Romeo's man? what can he say in this?
le:
le:BALTHASAR
le:
le:    I brought my master news of Juliet's death;
le:    And then in post he came from Mantua
le:    To this same place, to this same monument.
le:    This letter he early bid me give his father,
le:    And threatened me with death, going in the vault,
le:    I departed not and left him there.
le:
le:PRINCE
le:
le:    Give me the letter; I will look on it.
le:    Where is the county's page, that raised the watch?
le:    Sirrah, what made your master in this place?
le:
le:PAGE
le:
le:    He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;
le:    And bid me stand aloof, and so I did:
le:    Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;
le:    And by and by my master drew on him;
le:    And then I ran away to call the watch.
le:
le:PRINCE
le:
le:    This letter doth make good the friar's words,
le:    Their course of love, the tidings of her death:
le:    And here he writes that he did buy a poison
le:    Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal
le:    Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.
le:    Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!
le:    See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
le:    That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.
le:    And I for winking at your discords too
le:    Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd.
le:
le:CAPULET
le:
le:    O brother Montague, give me thy hand:
le:    This is my daughter's jointure, for no more
le:    Can I demand.
le:
le:MONTAGUE
le:
le:    But I can give thee more:
le:    For I will raise her statue in pure gold;
le:    That while Verona by that name is known,
le:    There shall no figure at such rate be set
le:    As that of true and faithful Juliet.
le:
le:CAPULET
le:
le:    As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie;
le:    Poor sacrifices of our enmity!
le:
le:PRINCE
le:
le:    A glooming peace this morning with it brings;
le:    The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head:
le:    Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;
le:    Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished:
le:    For never was a story of more woe
le:    Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
le:
le:    Exeunt
