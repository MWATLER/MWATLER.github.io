<h1>Week 4 - High-Level Design, continued</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This week we continue our study on high-level design. We will look at reports, database design, 
  configuration and data flow. We will also look at UML, structure, behaviour and interaction diagrams.</p>

<h3>Reports</h3>

<p>Almost any nontrivial software project can use some kinds of reports. Business applications might
  include reports that deal with customers (who's buying, who has unpaid bills, where customers
  live), products (inventory, pricing, what's selling well), and users (which employees are selling a lot,
  employee work schedules).</p>

<p>Often customers can give you lists of existing reports that they use now and that they
  want in the new system. They may also think of some new reports that take
  advantage of the new system's features. Adding dozens of new reports throughout the 
  development cycle can be a burden to the developers. You can allow the users to create their own reports. If the
  application uses a SQL database, it's not too hard to buy or build a reporting tool
  that lets users type in queries and see the results. If you use this technique, however, you may need to restrict access to it so the
  users don't see confi dential data. Some SQL statements can also damage the database. For example, the SQL DROP
  TABLE statement can remove a table from the database, destroying all its data.</p>

<h3>Other Outputs</h3>  
<p>In addition to normal reports, you should consider other kinds of outputs that the application might
  create. The application could generate printouts (of reports and other things), web pages, data fi les,
  image fi les, audio (to speakers or to audio fi les), video, output to special devices (such as electronic
  signs), e-mail, or text messages (which is as easy as sending an e-mail to the right address).</p>

<h3>Database</h3>  
<p>Database design is an important part of most applications. The fi rst part of database design is to
  decide what kind of database the program will need. You need to specify whether the application
  will store data in text fi les, XML files, a full-fledged relational database, or something more exotic
  such as a temporal database or object store. Even a program that doesn't use any database still needs
  to store data, perhaps inside the program within arrays, lists, or some other data structure.</p>
<p>If you use a relational database, you can sketch out the tables it contains and their relationships
  during high-level design. Later you can provide more details such as the specifi c fi elds in each table
  and the fi elds that make up the keys linking the tables.</p>

<p>Use good database design practices to ensure that the database is properly normalized. This will be 
  covered in more detail in low-level design.

<h4>Audit Trails</h4>

<p>An audit trail keeps track of each user who modifi es (and in some applications l views) a specific
  record. Later, management can use the audit trails to see which employee gave a customer a 120-percent 
  discount. Auditing can be as simple as creating a history table that records a user's name,
  a link to the record that was modifi ed, and the date when the change occurred. Some database
  products can even create audit trails for you.</p>
