<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h3>Numerical Methods for the Solution of Analog Electronic Circuits</h3>

<p>Simulation is a very important part of design. Most hardware projects undergo rigorous simulations before 
    implementation actually occurs. Simulating the behaviour of an analog circuit is quite simple. One can 
    simply obtain the differential equation for the circuit, and use well known numerical methods to solve them.</p>

<p>Several numerical algorithms are well know. Below is a summary of a few:
<ul>
<li><b>Euler's method.</b> The Euler method (also called forward Euler method) is a first-order numerical procedure 
    for solving ordinary differential equations with a given initial value. It is the most basic explicit 
    method for numerical integration of ordinary differential equations. The Euler method is a first-order method, 
    which means that the local error (error per step) is proportional to the square of the step size, and the global 
    error (error at a given time) is proportional to the step size. The Euler method often serves as the basis to 
    construct more complex methods. One way to think about Euler's method is that it uses the
    derivative at the current solution point (t0, u0) to create a linear prediction of the solution at the next time t1. </li>
<li><b>Midpoint method.</b> The midpoint method tries for an improved prediction over the Euler's method. It does this
    by taking an initial half step in time, sampling the derivative there, and then using that forward information as the slope.
    In other words, it replaces the tangent line by a line that is starting to bend correctly.</li>
<li><b>Runge-Kutta method.</b> One of the standard workhorses for solving ordinary differential equations is the called the Runge-Kutta 
    method. This method is simply a higher order approximation to the midpoint method. Instead of shooting to the midpoint, estimating 
    the derivative, the shooting across the entire interval - the Runge-Kutta method, in a sense takes, four steps, shooting
    across one quarter of the interval, estimating the derivative, then shooting to the midpoint, and so on. The precise
    manner in which the method propagates across a time step is done in the optimal way for the four steps</li>
</ul>

</p>

<p>The problem of applying well known numerical methods to solving analog electronic circuits is that these methods assume 
    linear behaviour. The key point that distinguishes a nonlinear circuit from a linear circuit is the relationship between 
    the input and output signal. If you graph the output signal versus the input signal for a linear circuit, then the graph 
    will be a straight line for all input signal levels. With a nonlinear circuit, the output will not be a straight line. 
    Instead, the output will be a curve.</p>

<p>It is likely that all the circuits you built were linear circuits, meaning they only contained resistors, capacitors, and non-ferritic 
    inductors. While this is a great way to get an important introduction into the fundamentals of basic circuits, almost all modern 
    circuits contain many more complicated elements and functionality. For a discussion of linear and nonlinear circuits, see 
    <a href="https://resources.pcb.cadence.com/blog/2019-the-basics-of-linear-vs-nonlinear-circuits" target="_blank">The Basics of Linear vs. Nonlinear Circuits</a>.
</p>

<p>To summarize, linear devices include resistors, capacitors, and most inductors when driven with low current.
    Nonlinear devices include semiconductor devices (transistors and diodes), ferrite inductors driven at high 
    current where magnetic saturation occurs, all amplifiers, and almost all integrated circuits. Therefore, for 
    non-linear circuits, we cannot rely on numerical methods and we have to take another approach.</p>

<h3>The Machine Learning Cost Function</h3>

<p>The machine learning cost function attempts to approximate real data with a hypothetical equation. Let us say we 
wish to approximate data with a first order function:<br>
h<sub>&#952;</sub>(x) = &#952;<sub>0</sub> + &#952;<sub>1</sub> x<br>
The parameters we want to guess are &#952;<sub>0</sub> and &#952;<sub>1</sub>. We generate a cost function that determines the difference 
between actual data and this approximation by taking the square of the difference between the points. We choose 
&#952;<sub>0</sub> and &#952;<sub>1</sub> to minimize this difference. This is summarized below:<br><br>

</p>

<p>It is possible to apply the machine learning cost function to non-linear electronic circuits if we expand 
    h<sub>&#952;</sub>(x) to a much higher order equation. For instance:<br>
h<sub>&#952;</sub>(x) = &#952;<sub>0</sub> + &#952;<sub>1</sub> x + &#952;<sub>2</sub> x<sup>2</sup> + &#952;<sub>2</sub> x<sup>3</sup> ...<br><br>
We could apply voltages to the circuits and measure the currents we seek, determine the optimum &#952;'s, and use that to predict behaviour.
