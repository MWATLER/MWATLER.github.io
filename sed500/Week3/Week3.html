<h3>High-Level Design</h3>

<p>High-level design provides a view of the system at an abstract level. It shows how the major
  pieces of the fi nished application will fi t together and interact with each other.
  A high-level design should also specify assumptions about the environment in which the
  fi nished application will run. For example, it should describe the hardware and software you
  will use to develop the application, and the hardware that will eventually run the program.
  The high-level design does not focus on the details of how the pieces of the application will
  work. Those details can be worked out later during low-level design and implementation.</p>

<p>You can view software development as a process that chops up the system into smaller and smaller
  pieces until the pieces are small enough to implement. Using that viewpoint, high-level design is the
  fi rst step in the chopping up process.
  The goal is to divide the system into chunks that are self-contained enough that you could give them
  to separate teams to implement.</p>
  
<h3>What to Specify</h3>
<p>The stages of a software engineering project often blur together, and that's as true for highlevel
  design as it is for any other part of development. Exactly what you should specify in the high-level 
  design varies somewhat, but some things are constant for most projects.</p>
  
<h4>Security</h4>
<p>The fi rst thing you see when you start most applications is a login screen. That's the fi rst obvious
  sign of the application's security, but it's actually not the fi rst piece. Before you even log in to the
  application, you need to log in to the computer.
  Your high-level design should sketch out all the application's security needs. Those needs may
  include the following:
<ul>
<li>Operating system security—This includes the type of login procedures, password expiration
  policies, and password standards. (Those annoying rules that say your password must
  include at least one letter, one number, one special character like # or %, and three Egyptian
  hieroglyphs.)</li>
<li>Application security—Some applications may rely on the operating system's security and not
  provide their own. Others may use the operating system's security to make the user reenter
  the same username and password. Still others may use a separate application username and
  password. Application security also means providing the right level of access to different
  users. For example, some users might not be allowed access to every part of the system. (I'll
  say more about this in the section “User Access” later in the chapter.)</li>
<li>Data security—You need to make sure your customer's credit card information doesn't fall
  into the hands of Eastern European hackers.</li>
<li>Network security—Even if your application and data are secure, cyber banditos might steal
  your data from the network.</li>
<li>Physical security—Many software engineers overlook physical security. Your application
  won't do much good if the laptop it runs on is stolen from an unlocked office.</li>
</ul>
