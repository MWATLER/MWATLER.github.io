    <p>This is a sample <strong>Part #2</strong> of the Midterm test. This sample test doesn’t contribute in any way to your mark. This sample test is designed as an example of the <strong>type of question</strong> you will have and the procedure to deliver your answer; it is not an indication of the difficulty of the question or the concepts being tested.</p>
    <p>In this part you must design and code a custom type (user-defined type) according to instructions given in English.</p>
    <h1 id="instructions-for-students">Instructions for Students</h1>
    <p>You are allowed to use any tool and material available to you during the test. The following are considered plagiarism:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>exchanging messages in any form with another person during the test.</li>
      <li>allowing access to your questions/solutions to somebody else before the test due date.</li>
      <li>acquiring the test questions/solutions that somebody else had before the test due date.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1 id="sample-question-1">Sample Question 1</h1>
    <p>Inspect the following type definition below which is used to store an on/off switch.</p>
    <pre>
      <code class="language-cpp">enum class StateType
{
    boolean,
    character,
    number
};

typedef struct
{
    char name[20];
    StateType sType;   
    union
    {
        bool stateAsBool;
        char stateAsChar;
        int stateAsNum;
    } sState;
} Switch;
</code>
    </pre>
    <p>A switch is considered <strong>ON</strong> if the value satisfies one of the conditions below.</p>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>State Type</th>
          <th>sState ("on" value)</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>boolean</td>
          <td>true</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>character</td>
          <td>'O'</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>number</td>
          <td>1</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>Use the <code>Switch</code> definition above to build a class that models a home stereo system. Such a system will have output channels such as TV, DVD, Bluetooth device, Computer, etc.  Each <code>Switch</code> object represents the current state of an output channel.</p>
    <h3 id="basic-details">Basic Details</h3>
    <p>Your <code>HomeStereo</code> class has the following data members</p>
    <ul>
      <li>an array of <strong>dynamically allocated</strong><code>Switch</code>-typed values</li>
      <li>a <strong>non-negative integer</strong> that stores the number of values in the array</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A <code>HomeStereo</code> object can be created using a <strong>2-argument Constructor</strong>.</p>
    <h3 id="public-member-functions">Public Member Functions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>displayOutputState()</code>: receives an <strong><code>ostream</code> reference</strong> (defaults to standard output) and returns an <strong><code>ostream</code> reference</strong>. This function inserts the state of all switches into the given output stream. The output should be in the following form.</li>
    </ul>
    <pre>
      <code class="language-txt">Channel Name: xxxxxx - State [on/off]&lt; endl &gt;
Channel Name: xxxxxx - State [on/off]&lt; endl &gt;
...
</code>
    </pre>
    <h3 id="other-features">Other Features</h3>
    <p>Include in your design all special member functions required to manage your objects.</p>
    <h3 id="misc">Misc</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>You are allowed to add as many <em>private</em> members as your design requires!</strong>
    </p>
    <p>Put in the answer box the content of your header file and implementation file. Both files must be properly created according to C++ standard and best practices.</p>
