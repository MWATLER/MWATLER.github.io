    <p>This is a sample <strong>Part #3</strong> of the Midterm test. This sample test doesn’t contribute in any way to your mark. This sample test is designed as an example of the <strong>type of question</strong> you will have and the procedure to deliver your answer; it is not an indication of the difficulty of the question or the concepts being tested.</p>
    <p>In this part you must design and code functions according to instructions.</p>
    <h1 id="instructions-for-students">Instructions for Students</h1>
    <p>You are allowed to use any tool and material available to you during the test. The following are considered plagiarism:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>exchanging messages in any form with another person during the test.</li>
      <li>allowing access to your questions/solutions to somebody else before the test due date.</li>
      <li>acquiring the test questions/solutions that somebody else had before the test due date.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1 id="sample-question-1">Sample Question 1</h1>
    <p>Define a family of functions (a templated function) named <code>insertAtEnd</code> that inserts in a <strong>dynamically-allocated array</strong> of elements of any type another element at the end (resize the array).  The function should receive as parameters:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the dynamically-allocated array</li>
      <li>the size of the array</li>
      <li>the element to insert</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The function should return the resulted array.</p>
    <p>Specialize the function for the type <code>char</code>.  In this specialization the array must be null-terminated; the size parameter doesn't count the null-byte.</p>
    <p>The client code listed below uses your templated function, and should not contain memory leaks. The comments next to each statement shows the content the array should have <strong>after</strong> the statement is executed.</p>
    <p>A type that uses this template must include in its definition certain functions and/or operators. <strong>Identify each function and/or operator that your template assumes is defined.</strong> You may do so in the form of an exact prototype or an English descriptive phrase.</p>
    <p>Write your solution in the textbox below.</p>

      <code class="language-cpp">// assume all necessary headers have been included
