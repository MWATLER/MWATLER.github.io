Input3: [wind]
Input3: [clop clop clop]
Input3: ARTHUR: Whoa there!
Input3: [clop clop clop]
Input3: SOLDIER #1: Halt! Who goes there?
Input3: ARTHUR: It is I, Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon, from the castle of Camelot. King of the Britons, defeator of the Saxons, sovereign of all England!
Input3: SOLDIER #1: Pull the other one!
Input3: ARTHUR: I am. And this my trusty servant Patsy. We have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights who will join me in my court of Camelot. I must speak with your lord and master.
Input3: SOLDIER #1: What, ridden on a horse?
Input3: ARTHUR: Yes!
Input3: SOLDIER #1: You're using coconuts!
Input3: ARTHUR: What?
Input3: SOLDIER #1: You've got two empty halves of coconut and you're bangin' 'em together.
Input3: ARTHUR: So? We have ridden since the snows of winter covered this land, through the kingdom of Mercea, through--
Input3: SOLDIER #1: Where'd you get the coconut?
Input3: ARTHUR: We found them.
Input3: SOLDIER #1: Found them? In Mercea? The coconut's tropical!
Input3: ARTHUR: What do you mean?
Input3: SOLDIER #1: Well, this is a temperate zone.
Input3: ARTHUR: The swallow may fly south with the sun or the house martin or the plumber may seek warmer climes in winter yet these are not strangers to our land.
Input3: SOLDIER #1: Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?
Input3: ARTHUR: Not at all, they could be carried.
Input3: SOLDIER #1: What -- a swallow carrying a coconut?
Input3: ARTHUR: It could grip it by the husk!
Input3: SOLDIER #1: It's not a question of where he grips it! It's a simple question of weight ratios! A five ounce bird could not carry a 1 pound coconut.
Input3: ARTHUR: Well, it doesn't matter. Will you go and tell your master that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here.
Input3: SOLDIER #1: Listen, in order to maintain air-speed velocity, a swallow needs to beat its wings 43 times every second, right?
Input3: ARTHUR: Please!
Input3: SOLDIER #1: Am I right?
Input3: ARTHUR: I'm not interested!
Input3: SOLDIER #2: It could be carried by an African swallow!
Input3: SOLDIER #1: Oh, yeah, an African swallow maybe, but not a European swallow. That's my point.
Input3: SOLDIER #2: Oh, yeah, I agree with that.
Input3: ARTHUR: Will you ask your master if he wants to join my court at Camelot?!
Input3: SOLDIER #1: But then of course, uh, African swallows are non-migratory.
Input3: SOLDIER #2: Oh, yeah.
Input3: SOLDIER #1: So, they couldn't bring a coconut back anyway.
Input3: [clop clop clop]
Input3: SOLDIER #2: Wait a minute! Supposing two swallows carried it together?
Input3: SOLDIER #1: No, they'd have to have it on a line.
Input3: SOLDIER #2: Well, simple! They'd just use a strand of creeper!
Input3: SOLDIER #1: What, held under the dorsal guiding feathers?
Input3: SOLDIER #2: Well, why not?
