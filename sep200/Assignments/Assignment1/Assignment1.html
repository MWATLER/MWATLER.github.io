<h2>SEP200 â€“ Assignment 1: Card Game</h2>

<h3>Due: March 25, 2022</h3>

<h4><b><u>Business Case</u></b> (Marketing, Project Manager, Senior Executives)</h4>
<p>There is a market for gaming software. One of the most popular card games is "21". We need to write software that simulates this card game 
    so players can play without actual cards. In addition to that, the gaming software can add features to the game "21" which are not 
    available with physical cards.</p>


<h4><b><u>Requirements</u></b> (Marketing, Project Manager, Project Lead)</h4>
<p>For simulating the card game "21", the following requirements must be implemented:</p>
<ol>
    <li>The sum of the cards must be as close to 21 as possible without going over.</li>
    <li>All cards have integral (integer) values.</li>
    <li>Introduce a high-definition mode to add granularity to the card draws. In this mode all cards have decimal (double floating point) values.</li>
    <li>The card draws must be random within a certain range. These can be called "attack cards".</li>
    <li>Introduce "dependent cards" which subtract from the card total to add complexity to the game. These cards are drawn 
        at random within a certain range.</li>
    <li>Allow two players at a time.</li>
    <li>For each game, the players can make a bet within a certain range.</li>
</ol>

<h4><b><u>Design</u></b> (Project Lead, Senior Engineers)</h4>

<b>Each Player</b><br>
<ul>
<li>Each player has a name.</li>
<li>Each player has cash.</li>
<li>Each player has a list of dependent cards which are always integral regardless of the game mode.</li>
<li>Each player's dependent cards have a value between 1 and 5 inclusive.</li>
<li>Each player can be created with name set to an empty string, no dependent cards, and $1000.00 in cash.</li>
<li>Each player can be created with name passed by argument, no dependent cards, and $1000.00 in cash.</li>
<li>Each player can be created from another player.</li>
<li>Each player can be assigned all its data from another player through the <b>=</b> operator.</li>
<li>Each player provides accessor functions to set or get the name.</li>
<li>Each player provides a function to add dependent cards, deleting any existing list of dependent cards first.</li>
<li>Each player provides a function to add one dependent card to an existing list of dependent cards.</li>
<li>Each player provides a function to sum the dependent cards.</li>
<li>Each player provides functions to get cash and to add cash (could be negative).</li>
<li>Each player cleans itself up before destruction.</li>
</ul>

<b>The Players</b><br>
<ul>
<li>The players override the <b>=</b>, <b>&lt;</b> and <b>&gt;</b> operators to see respectively if they are equal,
     if the first player has less points than the second, or if the first player has more points than the second.</li>
<li>The players override the <b>&lt;&lt;</b> and <b>&gt;&gt;</b> to respectively add cash or remove cash from a player.</li>
</ul>

<b>The Youth Player</b><br>
<p>In addition to those qualities for a player, the youth player has the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The youth player has a list of attack cards which can be integral (regular mode) or decimal (high definition mode).</li>
    <li>The youth player's attack cards have a value between 1 and 10 inclusive.</li>
    <li>The youth player's high definition attack cards will have values to three decimal places.</li>
    <li>The youth player can be created with no attack cards.</li>
    <li>The youth player can be created with a name passed by argument and no attack cards.</li>
    <li>The youth player can be created from another youth player.</li>
    <li>The youth player can be assigned all its data from another youth player through the <b>=</b> operator.</li>
    <li>The youth player provides a function to add attack cards, deleting any existing list of attack cards first.</li>
    <li>The youth player provides a function to add one attack card to an existing list of attack cards.</li>
    <li>The youth player provides a function to sum the attack cards.</li>
    <li>The youth player cleans itself up before destruction.</li>
    </ul>

<b>The Adult Player</b><br>
<ul>
    <li>The adult player has a list of attack cards which can be integral (regular mode) or decimal (high definition mode).</li>
    <li>The adult player's attack cards have a value between 1 and 15 inclusive.</li>
    <li>The adult player's high definition attack cards will have values to three decimal places.</li>
    <li>The adult player can be created with no attack cards.</li>
    <li>The adult player can be created with a name passed by argument and no attack cards.</li>
    <li>The adult player can be created from another adult player.</li>
    <li>The adult player can be assigned all its data from another adult player through the <b>=</b> operator.</li>
    <li>The adult player provides a function to add attack cards, deleting any existing list of attack cards first.</li>
    <li>The adult player provides a function to add one attack card to an existing list of attack cards.</li>
    <li>The adult player provides a function to sum the attack cards.</li>
    <li>The adult player cleans itself up before destruction.</li>
</ul>

<h4><b><u>Implementation</u></b> (Junior and Senior Engineers)</h4>

<b>The Card Game "21"</b><br>

<p>As an engineer on this project, you have to implement the code for the card game "21".</p>

<ol>
    <li>Create a UML diagram showing the classes and class relationships.</li>
    <li>Implement the classes for the players.</li>
    <li>A card game has been created for you, written partially in C++ but written mostly in pseudo-code. Once you have
        implemented your classes, implement the pseudo-code according to the instructions found in the main function of
        <a href="PlayerMain.cpp" target="_blank">PlayerMain.cpp</a>.</li>
</ol>

<h4><b><u>Testing and Rework</u></b> (Junior and Senior Engineers, Product Support)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Be sure to test your code for regular mode and high definition mode.</li>
<li>A correctly running card "21" program in high definition mode might look something like:<br>

<h4><b><u>Questions</u></b></h4>
<ol>
    <li>In the main() function, the number of players is hardcoded to 2. How could we modify the main() function to let the players decide 
        how many players there are? (0.5 mark)</li>
    <li>In the main() function, the players are hardcoded to play either the regular mode or the high definition mode. How could we modify the 
        main() function to let the players decide at runtime what modes they want to play in? (1 mark)</li>
    <li>How would you go about creating the players through an interface class? (0.5 mark)</li>
