<h1>Week 1 - Introduction</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This week will be an introduction to object oriented programming. We will also look at compilers and linkage, as well as some fundamental types. 
  We will look at static variables and functions, as well as external variables.
  During our lab period, we will look at the preprocessor which performs preliminary operations on C and C++ files before they are passed to the compiler. 
  The preprocessor can assist us with debugging our code.

<h3>Sample Code</h3>

<p><em>The Community Library</em></p>
<p>This example shows most of the principles of object oriented programming that we will learn in the first half of the course. The software to implement the community library
  represents a real-world situation that is implemented using object-oriented programming.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A community library is described in <a href="CommunityLibrary/CommunityLibraryDescription.docx" target="_blank">CommunityLibraryDescription.docx</a>. This is based on the lending policy of the 
      <a href="https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/using-the-library/borrowing-materials/" target="_blank">Toronto Public Library</a>, with exceptions. This library has patrons (customers) 
    who borrow its resources, which could be books, DVDs, musical instruments etc...</li>
    <li>A document which breaks down the components of the community library can be seen in the UML diagram <a href="CommunityLibrary/CommunityLibraryUML.docx" target="_blank">CommunityLibraryUML.docx</a>.
    This document shows the relationships between the library resource and its component parts (eBook, standard book, DVD, musical instruments) as well as the patron which 
    can borrow up to 5 library resources at a time.</li>
    <li>The source code for the library resource can be found at <a href="CommunityLibrary/LibraryResource.h" target="_blank">LibraryResource.h</a> and <a href="CommunityLibrary/LibraryResource.cpp" target="_blank">LibraryResource.cpp</a>.</li>
    <li>The source code for the book can be found at <a href="CommunityLibrary/Book.h" target="_blank">Book.h</a> and <a href="CommunityLibrary/Book.cpp" target="_blank">Book.cpp</a>.
      The source code for the eBook and the standard paper book can be found at <a href="CommunityLibrary/ElectronicBook.h" target="_blank">ElectronicBook.h</a> and <a href="CommunityLibrary/ElectronicBook.cpp" target="_blank">ElectronicBook.cpp</a>,
      <a href="CommunityLibrary/StandardPaperBook.h" target="_blank">StandardPaperBook.h</a> and <a href="CommunityLibrary/StandardPaperBook.cpp" target="_blank">StandardPaperBook.cpp</a>.</li>
    <li>The source code for the DVD can be found at <a href="CommunityLibrary/DVD.h" target="_blank">DVD.h</a> and <a href="CommunityLibrary/DVD.cpp" target="_blank">DVD.cpp</a>.</li>
    <li>The source code for the musical instrument can be found at <a href="CommunityLibrary/MusicalInstrument.h" target="_blank">MusicalInstrument.h</a> and <a href="CommunityLibrary/MusicalInstrument.cpp" target="_blank">MusicalInstrumentDVD.cpp</a>.</li>
    <li>The source code for the patron (customer) can be found at <a href="CommunityLibrary/Patron.h" target="_blank">Patron.h</a> and <a href="CommunityLibrary/Patron.cpp" target="_blank">Patron.cpp</a>.</li>
    <li>The main function for the community library can be found at <a href="CommunityLibrary/CommunityLibrary.cpp" target="_blank">CommunityLibrary.cpp</a> where two patrons are created, borrow library resources,
      then return them three days later. A report for each patron is generated and printed to the screen.</li>
  </ul>

<p><em>Personal Statistics</em></p>
<p>These two example shows the use of <b>extern</b> and <b>static</b> in C++ programming.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Code that uses <b>extern</b> can be seen with the following code:<br>
    <a href="PersonalStats/PersonalMain.cpp" target="_blank">PersonalMain.cpp</a>,
    <a href="PersonalStats/Insurance.cpp" target="_blank">Insurance.cpp</a>,
    <a href="PersonalStats/Insurance.h" target="_blank">Insurance.h</a>,
    <a href="PersonalStats/Pension.cpp" target="_blank">Pension.cpp</a>, and
    <a href="PersonalStats/Pension.h" target="_blank">Pension.h</a>.
  </li>
  <li>Code that uses <b>static</b> can be seen with the following code:<br>
    <a href="PersonalStats2/PersonalMain.cpp" target="_blank">PersonalMain.cpp</a>,
    <a href="PersonalStats2/Insurance.cpp" target="_blank">Insurance.cpp</a>,
    <a href="PersonalStats2/Insurance.h" target="_blank">Insurance.h</a>,
    <a href="PersonalStats2/Pension.cpp" target="_blank">Pension.cpp</a>, and
    <a href="PersonalStats2/Pension.h" target="_blank">Pension.h</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Employee Information</em></p>
<p>The example employee information shows the use of static class variables to keep track of how many objects have been created as well as a running total. The employee information 
  class contains variables for an employee's name, position and age. The static variable <b>numEmployees</b> keeps track of the number of objects created of type <b>EmployeeInfo</b>. 
  One of the functions of <b>EmployeeInfo</b> returns the average age. This function makes use of the static variable <b>runningTotal</b> where the average age is the running total 
  of ages divided by the number of employees. It is very common to employ a static variable to keep track of the number of objects created from a given class.<br> 
  The example shown also demonstrates the use of enumerations. A common application for enumerations is the error status returned by functions. See:<br>
  <a href="EmployeeInfo/EmployeeInfo.h" target="_blank">EmployeeInfo.h</a>,
  <a href="EmployeeInfo/EmployeeInfo.cpp" target="_blank">EmployeeInfo.cpp</a> and
  <a href="EmployeeInfo/EmployeeInfoMain.cpp" target="_blank">EmployeeInfoMain.cpp</a>.</p>

<p><em>Unions</em></p>
<p>The members of a union are arranged in parallel in memory.  Unlike the members in a class or a struct, the members in a union share the same address in memory 
  An object of union type can only hold the value of one of its members at any particular time. An example that shows how unions are used in conjunction with 
  enumerations to resolve which variable in a unions is to be accessed can be found in <a href="Union/Product.cpp" target="_blank">Product.cpp</a>.</p>

<p><em>Data Stream</em></p>
<p>Often streams of data come with a fixed width - 8 bits, 16 bits, 32 bits,... C++ has types with specific bit sizes which are used for parsing data streams.
  The code <a href="DataStream16/dataMain.cpp" target="_blank">dataMain.cpp</a> demonstrates the parsing of a 16 bit stream.</p>

<p><em>Generic Parameter</em></p>
<p>The data type (void *) represents no data type. Parameters can be passed to a function as (void *) and cast in that function to whatever type we wish. This is often used
  with threads where a thread is represented by a function that runs on its own and accepts one paramater of type (void *). A parameter of any type can be passed through to
  the thread. If multiple parameters need to be passed through to the thread, they can be packages into one structure and the structure passed through.
  The code <a href="GenericParameter/GenericMain.cpp" target="_blank">GenericMain.cpp</a> demonstrates the passing of a parameter by value or address, as well as the 
  passing of a structure by value or address.</p>

<p><em>Pointers, References and Arrays</em></p>
<p>There are many ways to initialize a pointer and use them in a for-next loop. The code
  <a href="TypeInference/TypeInference.cpp" target="_blank">TypeInference.cpp</a> uses a for-loop with type inference.</p>

  
<p><em>Macros</em></p>
<p>Macros in C++ have a wide variety of application. One such application is in debugging. Embedded debug can be enabled and disabled via 
  a simple <b>define</b>. Code with embedded debugging can also apply levels or severity of the debug. Debug logs can be filtered according 
  to their severity. Code with embedded debug can be seen at:<br>
  <a href="Debugging/Automobile.h" target="_blank">Automobile.h</a>,
  <a href="Debugging/Automobile.cpp" target="_blank">Automobile.cpp</a> and
  <a href="Debugging/TravelSimulator.cpp" target="_blank">TravelSimulator.cpp</a>.
</p>

<p>With this second example, the embedded debug has been enhanced in this code example to include an enumeration of log levels 
  (LOG_INFO, LOG_WARNING, LOG_ERROR, LOG_CRITICAL) as well as a nested-if inside the Log() macro:<br>
  <a href="PreProcessor/Automobile.h" target="_blank">Automobile.h</a>,
  <a href="PreProcessor/Automobile.cpp" target="_blank">Automobile.cpp</a> and
  <a href="PreProcessor/TravelSimulator.cpp" target="_blank">TravelSimulator.cpp</a>.
</p>

<p>One has to be careful in using macros, because of the way it expands in-line code. The following code demonstrates how a macro is expanded in-line in the code:<br>
  <a href="Cubed/Cubed.cpp" target="_blank">Cubed.cpp</a>.
