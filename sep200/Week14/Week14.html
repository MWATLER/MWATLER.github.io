<p><em>Personnel</em></p>
<p><b>Design Problem</b>: A personnel system is to be built up for students and faculty of Seneca College. All students and 
  faculty have a name, role (Student/Faculty), address and a seneca number. They may both also have an unknown number of 
  cars. Each car has a make, year and age which is calculated from the current year and year of the car. The students have 
  an unknown number of marks from which an average can be calculated. The faculty have salary.<br>

  <p>The main program should have the ability to create an unknown number of faculty and an unknown number of students. 
    Information for each faculty and student has to be passed through the constructor and/or the constructor prompt the 
    user for this information. After creating all faculty and student objects, the main program will print information 
    for each.</p>

  <p>In designing this personnel system, keep in mind the following:
<ul>
  <li>The use of enumerations in determining the role of the personnel (faculty/student).</li>
  <li>The use of the STL for arrays of unknown size.</li>
  <li>The use of polymorphism in designing a common class for faculty and student, as well as specialized classes for each.</li>
  <li>Passing information from a derived class to a base class. The derived class calling functions in the base class.</li>
  <li>The use of composition (aggregation) in assigning cars to the students and faculty.</li>
  <li>The use of exceptions for validating input data.</li>
  <li>The use of string concatenation in building up an information string.</li>
  <li>The use of smart pointers in the main function to create student and faculty objects.</li>
</ul>
