<h2>Final Test Review - Design</h2>

<p><em>Personnel</em></p>
<p><b>Design Problem</b>: A personnel system is to be built up for students and faculty of Seneca College. All students and 
  faculty have a name, role (Student/Faculty), address and a seneca number. They may both also have an unknown number of 
  cars. Each car has a make, year and age which is calculated from the current year and year of the car. The students have 
  an unknown number of marks from which an average can be calculated. The faculty have salary.<br>

  <p>The main program should have the ability to create an unknown number of faculty and an unknown number of students. 
    Information for each faculty and student has to be passed through the constructor and/or the constructor prompt the 
    user for this information. After creating all faculty and student objects, the main program will print information 
    for each.</p>

  <p>In designing this personnel system, keep in mind the following:
<ul>
  <li>The use of enumerations in determining the role of the personnel (faculty/student).</li>
  <li>The use of the STL for arrays of unknown size.</li>
  <li>The use of polymorphism in designing a common class for faculty and student, as well as specialized classes for each.</li>
  <li>Passing information from a derived class to a base class. The derived class calling functions in the base class.</li>
  <li>The use of composition (aggregation) in assigning cars to the students and faculty.</li>
  <li>The use of exceptions for validating input data.</li>
  <li>The use of string concatenation in building up an information string.</li>
  <li>The use of smart pointers in the main function to create student and faculty objects.</li>
</ul>
  </p>

<h2>Final Test Review - Coding Question</h2>

<p>The freighter is a cargo ship that carries a collection of items across the ocean such as cars, food, commodities, etc... 
  Various companies pay for the transportation of their items to markets across the world. For the freighter, a piece of cargo 
  should have a certain value ($10000) to make it profitable to carry. Complete the following program by 
  coding the class named <b>Freighter</b> and a global function named <b>calcTotalWorth</b>.</p>
  
  <h3>Freighter Class Requirements</h3>
  
  <p>Your <b>Freighter</b> class includes the following members:
  <ul>
  <li>STL container that holds <b>Cargo</b> objects</li>
  <li>Any other variable you feel is required</li>
  <li>Overloaded += operator that
      <ul>
          <li>Adds a Cargo object to the current object and returns a reference to the current object only 
              if the cargo is not of type Electronics</li>
          <li>If the cargo is of type Electronics, the operator should not change the current 
              object and throws an exception</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Overloaded -= operator that
    <ul>
        <li>Takes a name as argument and removes the first cargo with that name</li>
        <li>If the cargo cannot be found, it prints an error message</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>Overloaded [] operator that
      <ul>
          <li>Takes as an input a value (double)</li>
          <li>Returns the address of the first cargo object that is greater than this value</li>
          <li>If no such cargo exists, the function returns nullptr</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Overloaded [] operator that
    <ul>
        <li>Takes as an input an index (int)</li>
        <li>Returns the address of the cargo object at this index of the Cargo container</li>
        <li>If no such cargo exists, the function returns nullptr</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>A display function that:
      <ul>
          <li>Receives the address of one of the global functions that displays the requested information (byCargoType, byValue, byEverything)</li>
          <li>Displays the total worth of all cargo</li>
          <li>Calculates the total worth of all cargo in three threads. The thread function is <b>calcTotalWorth</b></li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  
  <h3>calcTotalWorth Function Requirements</h3>
  
  <ul>
      <li>The global function <b>calcTotalWorth</b> receives iterators to the beginning and end of a range of 
      <b>Cargo</b> objects.</li>
      <li>This function totals the value of the individual cargo objects</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Other Requirements</h3>
  
  <ul>
      <li>Upgrade the main function of the program to use a smart pointer</li>
      <li>Upgrade the main function to catch any exceptions</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Incomplete Code</h3>
  
  <p>The following code has been given to you. Please complete:<br>

<h2>Final Test Review - Algorithms</h2>

<p><em>Algorithms</em></p>
<p>An exercise with STL algorithms can be seen at <a href="Algorithms_release/Sprinter.cpp" target="_blank">Sprinter.cpp</a> which makes use of a list 
  of sprinters whom had set world records in both the 100m and 200m in the same year. A sample run can be seen at 
  <a href="Algorithms_release/sampleRun.txt" target="_blank">sampleRun.txt</a>. The solution can be seen at 
  <a href="Algorithms/Sprinter.cpp" target="_blank">Sprinter.cpp</a>.</p>
