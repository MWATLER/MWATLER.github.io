<h3>Sample Code</h3>

<p><em>Math Test</em></p>
<p>The program MathTest shows how to perform a square on a number and a square on a fraction. It does not matter what type the numbers are. They could be int, float, double, etc... 
  The code demonstrates the use of function templates:<br>
<a href="MathTest/Math.h" target="_blank">Math.h</a> and <a href="MathTest/MathTest.cpp" target="_blank">MathTest.cpp</a>.</p>

<p><em>A Database</em></p>
<p>A generic database has been created to perform functions on many data schematics. The database can find a data element by name, 
  get the number of data elements, get a data element by index, get the last data element, and get the first data element. The data element 
can be any kind of structure but must have a variable <b>name</b> which acts as the key into the database.<br>
An example is created with two types of data schematics (Database2, Database2).<br>The code for the database can be found in
<a href="Database/Database.h" target="_blank">Database.h</a> and the test code for the data base can be found at
<a href="Database/DatabaseMain.cpp" target="_blank">DatabaseMain.cpp</a>.</p>

<p><em>A Card Game (21) move Assignment 1 and provide a simpler example here??</em></p>
<p>A card player program simulates the card game 21. The object of this game is to draw cards in order that
  their sum is as close to 21 as possible without going over. In this game, a twist has been added. The user can draw "attack"
  cards which have positive values, but the user can also draw "dependent" cards, which have negative values. The players can
  play in regular mode, where all attack cards have integer values, or high-definition mode where all attack cards have double
  floating point values. All dependent cards have integer values. Since the values of the attack cards could be one of two types
  (int or double), templates are introduced. There are two types of players - youth and adult. When youth draw cards, the maximum
  value of a card is 10. When adults draw cards, the maximum value of a card is 15. Both youth and adults can draw as many
  "dependent" and "attack" cards as they want initially. They can choose to add an "attack" card or a "dependent" card only once
  afterwards. They are each given $1000 to begin with. Each round they can bet between $10 and $300.<br>
  The UML diagram can be found at: <a href="Player21/Player21.png" target="_blank">Player21.png</a>.<br>
  The code is as follows:
    <a href="Player21/PlayerBase.h" target="_blank">PlayerBase.h</a>,
    <a href="Player21/PlayerYouth.h" target="_blank">PlayerYouth.h</a>,
    <a href="Player21/PlayerAdult.h" target="_blank">PlayerAdult.h</a> and
    <a href="Player21/PlayerMain.cpp" target="_blank">PlayerMain.cpp</a>.</p>

<h3>Software Design with Object Oriented Programming based on the Use-Case Scenario</h3>
<p>We had an introduction to software design in SEP101 - Programming Fundamentals. We now want to extend the concepts taught there 
  towards object oriented programming.</p>
<ul>
<li>This requires breaking a problem down into classes, and breaking classes down into a collection of variables (nouns/adjectives) 
  and functions (verbs) which act on those variables.</li>
<li>Furthermore, it requires collecting common items into a base class, and specialized items into derived classes.</li>
<li>If variables and functions require a variety of data types, they need to be templated, regardless of whether they
   belong in a class or not.</li>
</ul>
