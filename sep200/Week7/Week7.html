<h3>Software Design with Object Oriented Programming based on the Use-Case Scenario</h3>
<p>We had an introduction to software design in SEP101 - Programming Fundamentals. We now want to extend the concepts taught there 
  towards object oriented programming.</p>
<ul>
<li>This requires breaking a problem down into classes, and breaking classes down into a collection of variables (nouns/adjectives) 
  and functions (verbs) which act on those variables.</li>
<li>Furthermore, it requires collecting common items into a base class, and specialized items into derived classes.</li>
<li>If variables and functions require a variety of data types, they need to be templated, regardless of whether they
   belong in a class or not.</li>
<li>With polymorphism, this allows access to all derived classes through a common base class, where all functions exposed 
   in the base class are declared as virtual.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is a general approach to object oriented design called the SOLID Principles of Object-Oriented Programming. See 
  <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/solid-principles-explained-in-plain-english/" target="_blank">The SOLID Principles of Object-Oriented Programming Explained in Plain English</a>.
</p>

<p><em>The Community Library</em></p>
<p>Let us look at our <a href="../Week1/CommunityLibrary/CommunityLibraryDescription.docx" target="_blank">Community Library</a> once more.
In this example, we see all library resources have a title, a catalog ID, a check-out date and a check-in date. These nouns/adjectives can
all be collected in a base class as variables: title (string), catalogID (int), checkOutDate (time_t), and checkInDate (time_t). Fees need
to be calculated for these resources. We also need to get and set these values. The actions performed on them can be collected as functions
in the base class, and overriden in derived classes: LibraryResource(int ID) constructor, CheckOut(time_t), CheckIn(time_t),
double CalculateFees(), string GetTitle(), and int GetCatalogID().</p>

<p>The calculation of fees depends on the type of library resource. The library resource could be a standard book, an electronic book, 
 a DVD, a musical instrument, or other resources (the default case). Other resources will rely on the CalculateFees() function in the 
 base class, but the other resources have to override the CalculateFees() function. The details for each can be seen in the document.</p>

<p>In addition to library resources there is a patron. This requires only one class because there is only one type of patron. 
  From the document it is seen that a patron has an id, a full name, a list of library resources and a record of late fees. These can 
  be stored as variables in the patron class. The patron can borrow resources and return resources. A report of the resources can be 
  generated and any fees calculated. Functions can implement all these actions in the patron class.</p>
  
<p>A full UML diagram of the solution can be seen at <a href="../Week1/CommunityLibrary/CommunityLibraryUML.docx" target="_blank">Community Library UML</a>. 
The UML diagram also shows how the patron interacts with library resources. Once a UML diagram has been generated, it is trivial to write the code for it:
<ul>
    <li>The source code for the library resource can be found at <a href="../Week1/CommunityLibrary/LibraryResource.h" target="_blank">LibraryResource.h</a> and 
      <a href="../Week1/CommunityLibrary/LibraryResource.cpp" target="_blank">LibraryResource.cpp</a>.</li>
    <li>The source code for the book can be found at <a href="../Week1/CommunityLibrary/Book.h" target="_blank">Book.h</a> and <a href="../Week1/CommunityLibrary/Book.cpp" target="_blank">Book.cpp</a>.
      The source code for the eBook and the standard paper book can be found at <a href="../Week1/CommunityLibrary/ElectronicBook.h" target="_blank">ElectronicBook.h</a> and 
      <a href="../Week1/CommunityLibrary/ElectronicBook.cpp" target="_blank">ElectronicBook.cpp</a>,
      <a href="../Week1/CommunityLibrary/StandardPaperBook.h" target="_blank">StandardPaperBook.h</a> and <a href="../Week1/CommunityLibrary/StandardPaperBook.cpp" target="_blank">StandardPaperBook.cpp</a>.</li>
    <li>The source code for the DVD can be found at <a href="../Week1/CommunityLibrary/DVD.h" target="_blank">DVD.h</a> and <a href="../Week1/CommunityLibrary/DVD.cpp" target="_blank">DVD.cpp</a>.</li>
    <li>The source code for the musical instrument can be found at <a href="../Week1/CommunityLibrary/MusicalInstrument.h" target="_blank">MusicalInstrument.h</a> and 
      <a href="../Week1/CommunityLibrary/MusicalInstrument.cpp" target="_blank">MusicalInstrumentDVD.cpp</a>.</li>
    <li>The source code for the patron (customer) can be found at <a href="../Week1/CommunityLibrary/Patron.h" target="_blank">Patron.h</a> and 
      <a href="../Week1/CommunityLibrary/Patron.cpp" target="_blank">Patron.cpp</a>.</li>
    <li>The main function for the community library can be found at <a href="../Week1/CommunityLibrary/CommunityLibrary.cpp" target="_blank">CommunityLibrary.cpp</a> 
      where two patrons are created, borrow library resources,
      then return them three days later. A report for each patron is generated and printed to the screen.</li>
    </ul>
