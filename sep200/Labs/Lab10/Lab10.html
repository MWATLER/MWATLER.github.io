<h2>SEP200 â€“ Lab 10: Multiple Inheritance/h2>

<h3>Due: end of week 13</h3>

<p>This lab will test your ability to use multiple inheritance in the design of an amphibious vehicle class. This 
    class will inherit from both an automobile class and a boat class. The lab will also test your ability to 
    use enumerations, class variables, and the smart pointer.</p>

    A sample run is as follows:<br>
<pre>
    The automobile will travel 200km
    Hydra Spyder automobile has 30.00L of fuel left. It has travelled 200.00km at a cost of $26.00.
    
    The boat will travel 20km
    Hydra Spyder boat has 130.00L of fuel left. It has travelled 20.00km at a cost of $32.00.
    
    Hydra Spyder in total has spent $58.00 on fuel.
    
    Adding 30L of fuel to the boat
    Hydra Spyder boat has encountered a fuel overflow. The amount added is actually 20.00L at a cost of $32.00.
    
    The boat will travel 200km
    Hydra Spyder boat is out of fuel. It actually travelled 150.00km at a cost of $240.00.
    
    Adding 30L of fuel to the automobile
    Hydra Spyder automobile has encountered a fuel overflow. The amount added is actually 20.00L at a cost of $26.00.
    
    The automobile will travel 300km
    Hydra Spyder automobile has 20.00L of fuel left. It has travelled 300.00km at a cost of $39.00.
    
    Hydra Spyder in total has spent $395.00 on fuel.
