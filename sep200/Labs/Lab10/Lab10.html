<h2>SEP200 â€“ Lab 10: Multiple Inheritance</h2>

<h3>Due: end of week 13</h3>

<p>This lab will test your ability to use multiple inheritance in the design of an amphibious vehicle class. This 
    class will inherit from both an automobile class and a boat class. The lab will also test your ability to 
    use enumerations, class variables, and the smart pointer.</p>

<p>The base class for this lab is called <b>Vehicle</b>. The classes <b>Automobile</b> and <b>Boat</b>
both inherit from this class. It should be possible to create an object of type <b>Automobile</b> to represent an 
automobile, and it should be possible to create an object of type <b>Boat</b> to represent a boat. Since an
amphibious vehicle is both a boat and an automobile, the class <b>AmphibiousVehicle</b> inherits from both
<b>Boat</b> and <b>Automobile</b>.</p>

<h3>The <b>Vehicle</b> class.</h3>
<p>The <b>Vehicle</b> class is an abstract class that declares an error status structure as well as function interfaces
required by all derived classes. The class has been started for you and can be found at <a href="Vehicle.h" target="_blank">Vehicle.h</a>. 
It contains the following:
<ul>
<li>The <b>Err_Status</b> enumeration is used for all derived classes and should the error status 
    for success, out of fuel, fuel overflow, and incorrect mode.</li>
<li>The <b>Travel</b> function takes distance as an argument and returns an error status.</li>
<li>The <b>AddFuel</b> function takes amount as an argument and returns an error status.</li>
<li>The <b>GetFuel</b> function simply returns the amount of fuel left in the tank.</li>
<li>The <b>GetCost</b> function simply returns the accumulated cost of all fuel purchases.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>The <b>Boat</b> class.</h3>
<p>The fuel efficiency for a boat is given in litres per hour. This assumes a constant travelling speed. The <b>Boat</b> class 
    has been started for you at <a href="Boat.h" target="_blank">Boat.h</a>. It completes the abstract <b>Vehicle</b> class as follows:
<ul>
<li>Add variables for name, litres consumed per hour, fuel in the tank and accumulated cost. Assume the boat travels at a 
    constant speed of 20.0 km/hour. Assume the cost per litre of boat fuel is $1.60. Assume the tank capacity is 150.0L.</li>
<li>The <b>constructor</b> passes through the boat's name, the litres consumed per hour, and the initial fuel in the tank. 
    Be sure to initialize the cost based on this fuel. Print out a message indicating how much fuel has been added and its cost.</li>
<li>The <b>Travel</b> function should accept distance as an argument and return an error status. Based on the distance travelled 
    and the constant travelling speed, the time of travel can be calculated. Knowing the litres consumed per hour, one can calculate 
    the amount of fuel consumed. If the fuel consumed is greater than the fuel in the tank, then you have to set the return status 
    to out of fuel, recalculate the actual distance travelled, the actual cost of the travel, set the fuel in the tank to zero, and 
    print out an error message that includes the actual distance and and actual cost. If there is enough fuel, decrease the fuel in 
    the tank by the fuel consumed, and calculate the cost of the travel. Print out a message showing how much fuel is left in the 
    tank, how far the boat travelled, and the cost of the travel.</li>
<li>The <b>AddFuel</b> function should accept an amount as an argument and return an error status. If the amount added will cause 
    the tank to overflow, set the return status to fuel overflow. Readjust the amount to result in a full tank. Print out an error 
    message that includes the actual amount added and the actual cost. if the amount added does not result in an overflow, 
    calculate the cost and add the amount to the fuel in the tank. Print out a message showing the amount added and the cost.
	Be sure to always add the actual cost to the accumulated cost in either case.</li>
<li>The <b>GetFuel</b> function simply returns the amount of fuel in the tank.</li>
<li>The <b>GetCost</b> function simply returns the accumulated cost of all the fuel purchased.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>The <b>Automobile</b> class.</h3>
<p>The fuel efficiency for an automobile is given as L per 100km. The <b>Automobile</b> class has been started for you at 
    <a href="Automobile.h" target="_blank">Automobile.h</a>. It completes the abstract <b>Vehicle</b> class as follows:
<ul>
<li>Add variables for name, fuel efficiency (L per 100km), fuel in the tank and accumulated cost. Assume the cost per 
    litre of fuel is $1.30. Assume the tank capacity is 50.0L.</li>
<li>The <b>constructor</b> passes through the automobiles's name, the fuel efficiency, and the initial fuel in the 
    tank. Be sure to initialize the cost based on this fuel. Print out a message indicating how much fuel has been 
    added and its cost.</li>
<li>The <b>Travel </b> function should accept distance as an argument and return an error status. Based on the distance travelled 
    and the fuel efficiency, one can calculate the amount of fuel consumed. If the fuel consumed is greater than the fuel in the 
    tank, then you have to set the return status to out of fuel, recalculate the actual distance travelled, the actual cost of 
    the travel, set the fuel in the tank to zero, and print out an error message that includes the actual distance and and actual cost.
	If there is enough fuel, decrease the fuel in the tank by the fuel consumed, and calculate the cost of the travel. Print out 
	a message showing how much fuel is left in the tank, how far the automobile travelled, and the cost of the travel.</li>
<li>The <b>AddFuel</b> function should accept an amount as an argument and return an error status. If the amount added will cause 
    the tank to overflow, set the return status to fuel overflow. Readjust the amount to result in a full tank. Print out an error 
    message that includes the actual amount added and the actual cost. if the amount added does not result in an overflow, 
    calculate the cost and add the amount to the fuel in the tank. Print out a message showing the amount added and the cost.
    Be sure to always add the actual cost to the accumulated cost in either case.</li>
<li>The <b>GetFuel</b> function simply returns the amount of fuel in the tank.</li>
<li>The <b>GetCost</b> function simply returns the accumulated cost of all the fuel purchased.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>The <b>AmphibousVehicle</b> class.</h3>
<p>This class runs in two modes: automobile or boat. If it runs in the automobile mode, it will travel and add fuel to the 
automobile portion of the amphibious vehicle. Likewise, if run in the boat mode, it will travel and add fuel to the 
boat portion of the amphibious vehicle. The <b>AmphibiousVehicle</b> class therefore inherits from both the 
<b>Boat</b> class and the <b>Automobile</b> class. It has been started for you at 
<a href="AmphibiousVehicle.h" target="_blank">AmphibiousVehicle.h</a>. Please complete it as follows:
<ul>
<li>Add a variable for the name of the amphibious vehicle and add a variable for the operating mode.</li>
<li>Add three constant public class variables indicating these modes: none, automobile, boat.</li>
<li>The <b>constructor</b> passes through the name of the amphibious vehicle. This name should
	also be passed through to the boat and automobile classes.</li>
<li>The <b>Travel</b> function takes as an argument the distance and returns error status.
	Depending on the mode, the travel function will call either the travel function of the
	automobile class or the travel function of the boat class.</li>
<li>The <b>AddFuel</b> function takes as an argument the amount of fuel and returns error status.
	Depending on the mode, the add fuel function will call either the add fuel function of the
	automobile class or the add fuel function of the boat class.</li>
<li>Add <b>getter</b> functions for name, fuel and cost. When getting the fuel, be sure to return
	the total fuel used by both the boat and the automobile portions of the amphibious vehicle.
	Likewise, when getting the cost, be sure to return the costs of both the boat and automobile.</li>
<li>The <b>UnsetMode</b>functions unsets a mode, and a <b>SetMode</b> function sets a mode. 
    For instance, if we are changing from  the automobile mode to the boat mode, we have to unset the 
    automobile mode then set the boat mode. Do this using bitwise expressions.</li>
</ul>

<h3><b>AmphibiousVehicleMain</b></h3>
<p>The file is used to test the amphibious vehicle class. It can be found at 
    <a href="AmphibiousVehicleMain.cpp" target="_blank">AmphibiousVehicleMain.cpp</a>. There is only one task:
<ul>
<li>Add a smart pointer of type <b>AmphibiousVehicle</b>. Call the amphibious vehicle object <b>ampVehicle</b> 
    and name this amphibious vehicle as "<b>Hydra Spyder</b>".</li>
</ul>
</p>
