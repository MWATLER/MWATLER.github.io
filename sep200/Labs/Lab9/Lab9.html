<h2>SEP200 - Lab 9: Car Ratings</h2>

<h3>Due: April 7, 2023</h3>

<p>The Standard Template Library provides a rich set of algorithms that you can perform on your data. For non-standard data types 
    (user defined types) you can provide your own criteria for handling data in the form of a lambda function.</p>

<p>This lab will test your ability to use STL algorithms as you process data from a selection of cars. The information for 
    each car is stored in a structure that contains the car's name, country, reliability, fuel efficiency, and horse power.

<p>The test program <a href="CarRating.cpp" target="_blank">CarRating.cpp</a> provides you with a vector of cars with various ratings. 
The function <b>processCars()</b> asks that you complete the following tasks:
<ol>
    <li>Sort and print out all cars in order of their reliability rating (higher is better).</li>
    <li>Sort and print out all cars in order of their fuel efficiency (lower is better).</li>
    <li>Sort and print out all cars in order of their horse power (higher is better).</li>
    <li>Print out the average horse power of all German cars.</li>
    <li>Print out all cars with reliability greater than (or equal to) 8.0.</li>
    <li>Change the country of all American cars from "USA" to "United States".</li>
    <li>Reorganize the vector of all cars in order of their rating (higher is better) based on the formula:<br>
        <b>rating = 2.0*(reliability-4.1) + 2.0*(12.1-fuelEfficiency) + (horsePower-130.0)/37.0</b></li>
</ol>
Complete <b>processCars()</b> according to these instructions.
