<h2>SEP200 â€“ Lab 9: The inverse of a matrix</h2>

<h3>Due: end of week 12</h3>

<p>This lab will test your ability to use a functor with a two-dimensional array to calculate the inverse of a 3x3 matrix.</p>

<p>Functors have certain advantages over functions. Unlike functions, functors can have state. They fit into the object-oriented 
    paradigm as compared to functions because functors are actually based on classes. Functors are often inlined by the compiler, 
    unlike function pointers. The functor does not require runtime dispatching, therefore it is more efficient in most cases.</p>

<p>Your functor is going to look like a function to the calling program, but it is actually an object of a class called <b>inverse</b>.</p>

<h3>The <b>inverse</b> class.</h3>
<p>The <b>inverse</b> class has to perform the following:
<ul>
<li>The matrix that is passed to the <b>inverse</b> class may have floating point values or may have double floating 
    point values. The <b>inverse</b> class has to be generic enough to accommodate for both (or more) types.</li>
<li>The <b>inverse</b> class will present a function like interface to the calling program by overriding the operator <b>operator()</b>.</li>
<li>In determining the inverse of a matrix, one has to first determine the <b>determinant</b> of a matrix. 
    See <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/matrix-determinant.html" target="_blank">Determinant of a Matrix</a> as a guide 
    on how to calculate the <b>determinant</b> of a 3x3 matrix.</li>
<li>Once the <b>determinant</b> has been calculated, see 
    <a href="https://byjus.com/maths/inverse-of-3-by-3-matrix/" target="_blank">Inverse of a 3x3 Matrixc</a> as a guide on how to 
    calculate the inverse of a 3x3 matrix.</li>
<li>The <b>inverse</b> class may require a private matrix of dimension 3x3 to act as a temporary matrix to aid in the 
       matrix calculations. The values of this temporary matrix (if needed) should be initialized to 0.</li>
<li>You might want to make use of private functions to assist in all this. For instance, each value of the inverse matrix is calculated 
    from the <b>determinant</b> of a 2x2 submatrix. You may want to have a private function for calculating this <b>determinant</b> 
    since the code will be reused many times.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sample Run</h3>
<p>When you are finished, you can compare your answers with that of an online inverse matrix calculator found at 
    <a href="https://matrix.reshish.com/inverse.php" target="_blank">Inverse Matrix Calculator</a>. The test function 
    for this lab can be found at <a href="InverseMain.cpp" target="_blank">InverseMain.cpp</a>. An empty <b>inverse</b> class can be found at 
    <a href="Inverse.h" target="_blank">Inverse.h</a>. A sample run is as follows:<br>
<pre>
    The inverse of mat3x3 is:
    row 1: 0.0330946, 0.0753272, 0.0133366
    row 2: 0.0138306, -0.0879229, 0.0204989
    row 3: 0.0274142, 0.0400099, -0.048654
    
    The inverse of mat3x3 as a float is:
    row 1: 0.0330946, 0.0753272, 0.0133366
    row 2: 0.0138306, -0.0879229, 0.0204989
    row 3: 0.0274142, 0.0400099, -0.048654
    
    
    From the online inverse matrix calculator:
    134/4049  305/4049   54/4049
     56/4049 -356/4049   83/4049
    111/4049  162/4049 -197/4049
</pre>
