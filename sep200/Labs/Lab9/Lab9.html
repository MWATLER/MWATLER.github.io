<h2>SEP200 â€“ Lab 9: Reorder an Array</h2>

<h3>Due: April 8, 2022</h3>

<p>This lab will test your ability to use a custom stack class and a custom queue class. It will also test your ability 
    to use a standard algorithm from STL.</p>

<p>Please take a look at the custom stack and queue classes found in <a href="Stack.h" target="_blank">Stack.h</a> and complete 
    the tasks under TODO in <a href="Reorder.cpp" target="_blank">Reorder.cpp</a>.</p>


<h3>ReOrder</h3>
<p><b>ReOrder()</b> takes three arguments as shown in <a href="Reorder.cpp" target="_blank">Reorder.cpp</a>. Complete this function
     using stack and queue. The number 0 is used as a delimiter between sets of numbers. The new array should have all negative 
     numbers on one side and all positive numbers on the other side. The zero should be pushed to the end of the array.
	 See the sample run below.</p>

<h3>Custom Compare Function</h3>
<p>The custom compare function is used in conjunction with the standard sort function. The numbers to be sorted are of a standard 
    data type but create this custom compare function anyway. The function should result in a sorted array from the greatest number
    to the least number.</p>

<h3>Sample Run</h3>
<p>A sample run is as follows:<br><br>
<pre>
    array:    -3 2 -1 5 1 -4 0 11 12 13 -11 -12 0 -1 -2 6 8 7
    newArray: -3 -1 -4 1 5 2 -11 -12 13 12 11 -1 -2 7 8 6 0 0
    newArray sorted: 13 12 11 8 7 6 5 2 1 0 0 -1 -1 -2 -3 -4 -11 -1
</pre>
</p>

<p>Be sure to document your code with the file name, your name and student number. Add comments throughout the code where necessary.</p>

<h3>Questions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Do you see any application for lambda functions in C++?</li>
    <li>Is <b>int</b> a class or an object? Is <b>a</b> in <b>int a;</b> a class or an object?</li>
    <li>If you were to create a type or class called complex_number which has all the operations of an int, what operators would 
        you have to overload to create a complex_number class?</li>
</ol>
