<h2>SEP200 â€“ Lab 2: Real Estate</h2>

<h3>Due: February 4, 2022</h3>

<p>This lab will test your ability to perform deep and shallow copies, overload operators, friendship, and use the copy constructor and assignment as well as the move constructor and assignment.</p>

<p>This program creates objects of type <b>House</b>. Each house has an owner, address, rooms, bathrooms, and a price. The class functions that operate on this data are as follows:
<ul>
    <li>House();//Default constructor</li>
    <li>House(const char* _owner, const char* _address, const double _rooms, const double _bathrooms, const double _price);//Data for the house object</li>
    <li>House(const House& house);//Copy constructor</li>
    <li>House& operator=(const House& house);//Copy assignment</li>
	<li>House(House&& house) noexcept;//Move constructor</li>
	<li>House& operator=(House&& house) noexcept;//Move assignment</li>

	<li>bool ChangeOwner(char* newOwner);//Change the owner. Test to see if the character array newOwner actually exists. If it doesn't, return <b>false</b>, otherwise return <b>true</b>.</li>
	<li>bool ChangePrice(double newPrice);//Change the price. Test to see if the price is a positive number. If it isn't, return <b>false</b>, otherwise return <b>true</b>.</li>
	<li>const House& operator+=(double amount);//increase/decrease the price of the house</li>
	<li>void DisplayInfo() const;//Display the owner, address, rooms, bathrooms, and price. All double's should be printed to two decimal places.</li>
	<li>~House();//Destructor</li>
</ul>
There are also two functions that operate on this data from outside the class. They are as follows:
<ul>
    <li>bool operator==(const House& house1, const House& house2);//Do the two houses have the same owner?</li>
    <li>void operator>>(House& house1, House& house2);//Move contents from the house1 object to the house2 object</li>   
</ul>
Note that operator==(...) might require access to private members of the House object, so you may have to modify <b>House.h</b>.
</p>

<p>You have been given a header file for <b>House</b> and a main file for testing:
    <a href="House.h" target="_blank">House.h</a> and
    <a href="HouseMain.cpp" target="_blank">HouseMain.cpp</a>.<br>
Complete <b>House.cpp</b>.</p>

<p>A sample run is as follows:<br><br>

<h3>Questions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Do you feel operator overloading in general might introduce risk to a program? How?</li>
    <li>Does the overloading of the <b>>></b> operator add clarity to the program? If so, why? If not, why?</li>
    <li>Give three operators which cannot be overloaded. Explain why for each.</li>
</ol>
