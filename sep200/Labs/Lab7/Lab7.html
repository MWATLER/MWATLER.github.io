<h2>SEP200 â€“ Lab 7: A Cellphone Customer Database</h2>

<h3>Due: March 25, 2022</h3>

<p>This lab will test your ability to use class variables, enumerations and standard maps.</p>

<p>A cellphone company wants to keep track of its customers. It records the customer's name, address, customer number and cell phone number in 
    a standard map with the cell phone number as the key. There are 160,000 entries in this database.</p>

<p>The test program <a href="CustomerBase.cpp" target="_blank">CustomerBase.cpp</a> builds this database for you. You have to create
    a customer class that can be constructed by the customer's name, address, customer number and cell phone number. This class should 
    have get functions for all of these as well as a get function for full customer information. This class should have set functions 
    for the customer's name, address and phone number. The class should have a function to zero all of the data, because we do not want 
    this information lingering around in the binary after the program has completed. Since we are using a map with a non-standard data 
    type we have to specify how to order the data. This has been given to you.</p>

<p>More details are as follows:</p>
    
<h3>The Customer Class</h3>
<p>A general outline of the customer class has been given to you in <a href="Customer.h" target="_blank">Customer.h</a> and
    <a href="Customer.cpp" target="_blank">Customer.cpp</a>. As we create customers, we have to keep track of the number of 
    customers we create.</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Customer()</b>. The default customer constructor will take the number of customers as the client number. It will zero or 
        blank out all the other variables.</li>
    <li><b>Customer()</b>. The second customer constructor will set the name, address, and phone number of the customer. It will use 
        the number of customers as the client number.</li>
    <li><b>Get Functions</b>. You need get functions for name, address, customer number and phone number.</li>
    <li><b>GetCustomerInfo()</b>. You need a get customer information function that returns a string consisting of the 
    customer's name, address, client number and phone number. Be sure to format this information in some way.</li>
    <li><b>Set Functions</b>. You need set functions for name, address and phone number. These functions return an 
    error status. For string entries, return invalid data if the string entered is empty and return resource not available
    if you are not able to assign the string to your local variable (use the test variable.size()<=0). For the phone 
    number, return invalid data if the number is less than 0 or greater than 9999999999.</li>
    <li><b>ZeroData()</b>. Zero the data by setting the name and address to an empty string and setting the customer number 
    and phone number to 0.</li>
    <li><b>operator<()</b>. Since this map is based on a non-standard data type, we have to tell it how to sort the data. 
    This has been done for you. This is an internal feature of std::map.</li>
</ul>
    
<h3>The Customer Base Test Function</h3>
<p>The main() function of <a href="CustomerBase.cpp" target="_blank">CustomerBase.cpp</a> builds a database of 160,000 
    and performs certain tests on the database. Please follow and complete the instructions embedded in the code.</p>

<h3>Sample Run</h3>
<p>A sample run is as follows:<br><br>
<pre>
    Name:           Bdqm Cern
    Address:        56 Dfso Drive
    Customer Number:1112
    Phone Number:   1111112222
    
    Name:           Darryl Smith
    Address:        1 Bloor Street
    Customer Number:1112
    Phone Number:   9051112222
    
    Cannot find the customer
    
    Name:
    Address:
    Customer Number:0
    Phone Number:   0
</pre>
</p>

<p>Be sure to document your code with the file name, your name and student number. Add comments throughout the code where necessary.</p>

<h3>Questions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>How does the std::map build a database? In a linear format or in a tree format?</li>
    <li>How is this format advantageous?</li>
    <li>Explain more the need for operator&lt;().</li>
</ol>
