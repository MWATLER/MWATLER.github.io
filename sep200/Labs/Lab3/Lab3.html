<h2>SEP200 - Lab 3: Amazon Purchases</h2>

<h3>Due: February 10, 2023</h3>

<p>This lab will test your ability to create and use base classes and derived classes.</p>

<p>This program records purchases from Amazon and calculates the cost. There are three types of items that a user can purchase - a book, a DVD, or a digital music 
    download. For each item there is a title, a list of authors, and a price. For each item you need to get information and you need to calculate the costs. You 
    will create four classes as follows:</p>

<h3>The Generic Item</h3>
<p>This contains everything that is common to all types of purchases.</p>
<ul>
    <li>By default generic item will create an object with the title set to an empty string, the list of authors to a nullptr, the number of authors to 0, and the price to $0.00.</li>
    <li>The generic item can also be created with the following data - the 
        title, the number of authors, and the price. The constructor will prompt the user for the authors. Since the number of authors is not known before runtime, 
        dynamic memory allocation will have to be used to get the list of authors.</li>
    <li>When asked to calculate the cost, generic item will simply return the price.</li>
    <li>When asked to get information, generic item will stream out the title, a list of authors, and the price to 2 decimal places.</li>
    <li>Be sure to cleanup on object destruction.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Book.</h3>
<p>This contains information specific to a book purchase.</p>
<ul>
    <li>When asked to calculate the cost, the book will add a 10% penalty to the price for using paper and 13% of the price for the harmonized sales tax.</li>
    <li>When asked to get information, book will stream out information from the generic item that it is derived from. It will also stream out one line specifying: 
        "There is a 10% penalty for using paper."</li>
</ul>

<h3>DVD.</h3>
<p>This contains information specific to a DVD purchase.</p>
<ul>
    <li>When asked to calculate the cost, the DVD will add a 5% penalty to the price for using plastic and 13% of the price for the harmonized sales tax.</li>
    <li>When asked to get information, the DVD will stream out information from the generic item that it is derived from. It will also stream out one line specifying: 
        "There is a 5% penalty for using plastic."</li>
</ul>

<h3>Digital Music Download.</h3>
<p>This contains information specific to the purchase of digital music download.</p>
<ul>
    <li>When asked to calculate the cost, the digital music download will add 13% of the price for the harmonized sales tax.</li>
    <li>When asked to get information, the DVD will stream out information from the generic item that it is derived from.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sample Run</h3>

<p>You have been given the main test program:
    <a href="AmazonMain.cpp" target="_blank">AmazonMain.cpp</a>. You have to create the header and CPP files for all the classes.</p>

<p>A sample run is as follows:<br><br>

<p>To assist you with this lab, you might want to look at the following sample code that keeps track of marks for students in three different ways. 
    The default way is by percentages. The other two ways is to have letter grades (A,B,C,D,F) or to have number grades (0-5):<br>
    <a href="Student/Student.h" target="_blank">Student.h</a>,
    <a href="Student/Student.cpp" target="_blank">Student.cpp</a>,
    <a href="Student/LetterStudent.h" target="_blank">LetterStudent.h</a>,
    <a href="Student/LetterStudent.cpp" target="_blank">LetterStudent.cpp</a>,
    <a href="Student/NumberStudent.h" target="_blank">NumberStudent.h</a>,
    <a href="Student/NumberStudent.cpp" target="_blank">NumberStudent.cpp</a> and
    <a href="Student/StudentMain.cpp" target="_blank">StudentMain.cpp</a>.
</p>

<p>Be sure to document your code with the file name, your name and student number. Add comments throughout the code where necessary.</p>

<h3>Questions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>If all three purchases were of type DVD, could AmazonMain.cpp use a for-next loop to get all information?</li>
    <li>Since we have a Book purchase, a DVD purchase, and a digital music download purchase, could AmazonMain.cpp use a for-next loop to get all information? Why?</li>
</ol>
