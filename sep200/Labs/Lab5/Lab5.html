<h2>SEP200 â€“ Lab 5: A Company Database</h2>

<h3>Due: February 25, 2022</h3>

<p>This lab will test your ability to use templates as a means of parametric polmorphism.</p>

<p>This week you are going to use templates with  parametric polmorphism to build two company databases - one for regular employees and one for executives. The function 
    prototypes for accessing these databases are identical. What these functions do and the type of data they take are different.</p>
    
<h3>Company Common</h3>
<p>The common header file for this program will expose the structures for the databases and the functions which are common to both databases. 
    These functions are as follows.</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>AddPersonnel()</b>. This function will take as arguments a database object and the number of persons to be added to the database. It returns true if these persons have 
        been successfully added, false otherwise.</li>
    <li><b>FindPersonnel()</b>. This function will take as arguments a database object, the name of the person to be found, and a reference to 
    the person found. That person could be a regular employee or an executive. The function returns true if the person is found, false otherwise.</li>
    <li><b>CalculateSalary()</b>. This function takes as arguments a database object the name of a person and returns the person's salary. If the person is not found, 0.00 is returned.</li>
</ul>
<p>The header file for company base is partially complete. See <a href="CompanyCommon.h" target="_blank">CompanyCommon.h</a>.</p>
<p>In the header file you can see the structure for a standard employee and the structure for an executive.</p>
<p>Please note that in those functions where you are changing values in the database, you might have to pass the database as a reference instead of by value.</p>
    
<h3>Company Employee</h3>
<p>The database for the company employees will contain up to MAX_SIZE items of data.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The company employee list is based on the StandardEmployee structure. You will have to keep track of the number of employees.</li>
    <li>The company employee constructor should initialize any pointers to nullptr and any variables to 0 or "".</li>
    <li><b>AddPersonnel()</b>. This function will take as an argument the number of persons to be added to the database. It returns true if 
        these persons have been successfully added, false otherwise. It should test to see if 
    the maximum size has not been encroached. Any new employees have to be added to the list of employees. This means creating a new list 
    copied from the old list with space for the new employees at the end. Be sure to delete the old list. Each employee should be asked 
    the following:
    <ul>
        <li>Enter the employee's name: </li>
        <li>Enter the employee's position: </li>
        <li>Enter the employee's base salary: </li>
        <li>Enter the employee's annual profit sharing amount: </li>
        <li>Enter the employee's annual performance bonus: </li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><b>FindPersonnel()</b>. This function will take as arguments the name of the person to be found, and a reference to the person found. 
        That person is of type StandardEmployee. The function returns true if the person is found, false otherwise.</li>
    <li><b>CalculateSalary()</b>. This function takes as an argument the name of a person and returns the person's salary. If the person is not
        found, 0.00 is returned.</li>
</ul>
<p>Be sure to clean up on destruction.</p>

<h3>Company Executive</h3>
<p>The database for the company exeutives will contain up to MAX_SIZE items of data.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The company executive list is based on the ExecutiveEmployee structure. You will have to keep track of the number of executives.</li>
    <li>The company executive constructor should initialize any pointers to nullptr and any variables to 0 or "".</li>
    <li><b>AddPersonnel()</b>. This function will take as an argument the number of persons to be added to the database. It returns true if 
        these persons have been successfully added, false otherwise. It should test to see if 
    the maximum size has not been encroached. Any new executives have to be added to the list of executives. This means creating a new list 
    copied from the old list with space for the new executives at the end. Be sure to delete the old list. Each executive should be asked 
    the following:
    <ul>
        <li>Enter the executive's name: </li>
        <li>Enter the executive's position: </li>
        <li>Enter the executive's base salary: </li>
        <li>Enter the executive's annual stock option dividend: </li>
        <li>Enter the executive's annual perquisites: </li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><b>FindPersonnel()</b>. This function will take as arguments the name of the person to be found, and a reference to the person found. 
        That person is of type ExecutiveEmployee. The function returns true if the person is found, false otherwise.</li>
    <li><b>CalculateSalary()</b>. This function takes as an argument the name of a person and returns the person's salary. If the person is not
        found, 0.00 is returned.</li>
</ul>
<p>Be sure to clean up on destruction.</p>
