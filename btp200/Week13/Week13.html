<p><em>Final Review</em></p>
<ul>
<li>A final review has been prepared. Try to answer the questions on your own. Links to the solution have been provided. There are also 6 debugging questions with the answers to each at the bottom 
  of each file. See

<p><em>C++ Language Standards</em></p>
<p>The C++ language is evolving over time. See <a href="CPlusPlusStandards.PNG" target="_blank">C++ Standards</a> for a pictoral summary. A more detailed document can be found at 
  <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/history" target="_blank">History of C++</a>.</p>
<p>There are many libraries that extend the functionality of C++.
  For example, Blackberry uses the the <a href="http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/ACE.html" target="_blank">Adaptive Communication Environment</a> (ACE) library
  for concurrent communication software.</p>
  <p>The <a href="https://www.boost.org/" target="_blank">Boost C++ Libraries</a> offers extensions to every part of the C++ library. See the documentation of their latest 
  release <a href="https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_75_0/" target="_blank">Boost 1.75.0 Library Documentation</a> for more information.</p>
<p>For a full list of C++ compatible libraries see <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/links/libs" target="_blank">cppreference - A list of open source C++ libraries</a>. When 
you work in a specialized environment, these libraries become indispensible.</p>
