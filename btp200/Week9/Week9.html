<h3>Sample Code</h3>

<p><em>Statistics</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>This sample code is meant to assist with workshop 6 part 2. It shows parsing data from a file, counting the number of data members in a file. It also includes a 
    copy constructor, copy assignment, and destructor. The code basically extracts numbers from a file, calculates the average and the standard deviation. The numbers 
    are separated by the 'a' character. The code and data files can be seen at:<br>

  </li>
</ul>

<p><e>Quiz 7</e></p>
<ul>
  <li>The code for quiz 7 was studied with a few modifications to introduce the concepts of polymorphism. 
    The code can be found at: <a href="Quiz7/Quiz7.cpp" target="_blank">Quiz7.cpp</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Electronic Circuit</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>In week 6 we looked an an electronic circuit. There were inductors, capacitors and resistors. Our code passed current through these electronic components and 
    calculated the voltage across each. Now we are going to do the same thing, but we are going to introduce a base class for each of these components. The base class 
    or parent class will be called Component. The derived classes or children classes are Resistor, Capacitor, and Inductor. The main() function will access these
    derived classes through their base class, allowing all objects of all three kinds to be treated similarly. <br>
    The UML diagram can be seen at:<br>

    The code can be seen at:<br>

    <a href="SeriesCircuit/Inductor.cpp" target="_blank">Inductor.cpp</a>, and
    <a href="SeriesCircuit/SeriesCircuit.cpp" target="_blank">SeriesCircuit.cpp</a>
  </li>
  <li>In order to demonstrate the C++ interface, an interface class has been introduced, which acts as the parent class to Component which in turn acts as the 
    parent class to Resistor, Inductor and Capacitor. The interface class is accompanied by a CreateComponent function. The idea is, the user only sees the 
    interface without knowing how the electronic components are built. The CreateComponent function will act as a user-interface to guide the user in 
    building the electronic circuit.<br>
