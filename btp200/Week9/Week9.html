<h3>Sample Code</h3>

<p><em>Statistics</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>This sample code is meant to assist with workshop 6 part 2. It shows parsing data from a file, counting the number of data members in a file. It also includes a 
    copy constructor, copy assignment, and destructor. The code basically extracts numbers from a file, calculates the average and the standard deviation. The numbers 
    are separated by the 'a' character. The code and data files can be seen at:<br>

  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Electronic Circuit</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>In week 6 we looked an an electronic circuit. There were inductors, capacitors and resistors. Our code passed current through these electronic components and 
    calculated the voltage across each. Now we are going to do the same thing, but we are going to introduce a base class for each of these components. The base class 
    or parent class will be called Component. The derived classes or children classes are Resistor, Capacitor, and Inductor. The main() function will access these
    derived classes through their base class, allowing all objects of all three kinds to be treated similarly. <br>
