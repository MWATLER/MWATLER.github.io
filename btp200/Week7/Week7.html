<p><em>Midterm Review</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>For a review we will look at a bank manager in charge of several investment accounts. Each account has cash, stocks, and a name. One can purchase stocks, sell stocks, 
    add cash, and remove cash. The bank manager is a friend of the investment accounts so (s)he is capable of overriding the private members of these accounts. Several 
    transactions will be performed to demonstrate the concepts learned in the first 5 weeks of the course. The code is:<br>
    <a href="InvestmentAccount.h" target="_blank">InvestmentAccount.h</a>,
    <a href="InvestmentAccount.cpp" target="_blank">InvestmentAccount.cpp</a>,
    <a href="BankManager.h" target="_blank">BankManager.h</a>,
    <a href="BankManager.cpp" target="_blank">BankManager.cpp</a>, and
    <a href="BankMain.cpp" target="_blank">BankMain.cpp</a>.
  </li>
</ul>
