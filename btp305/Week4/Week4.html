<h1>Week 4 - Composition and Expressions</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This week we will look at composition, aggregation and association, and also advanced C++ expressions. The composition represents the 
  <b>has-a</b> relationship, in contrast to inheritance which is an <b>is-a</b> relationship.</p>

<h3>Sample Code</h3>

<p><em>Composition</em></p>
<p>It is possible for a class to contain an instance of another class (composition), a collection of instances of another class (aggregation), or an instance of another class which in turn 
  contains an instance of the class itself (association). We will look at three examples, one of each type.
<ul>
<li>
  In the first example, the class Person contains an instance of the class Name. This is implemented with a pointer:<br>
  <a href="Composition/Name.h" target="_blank">Name.h</a>,
  <a href="Composition/Name.cpp" target="_blank">Name.cpp</a>,
  <a href="Composition/Person.h" target="_blank">Person.h</a>,
  <a href="Composition/Person.cpp" target="_blank">Person.cpp</a> and
  <a href="Composition/CompositionMain.cpp" target="_blank">CompositionMain.cpp</a>. 
</li>

<li>
  In the second example, the class Club contains an aggregation of Names:<br>
  <a href="Aggregation/Name.h" target="_blank">Name.h</a>,
  <a href="Aggregation/Name.cpp" target="_blank">Name.cpp</a>,
  <a href="Aggregation/Club.h" target="_blank">Club.h</a>,
  <a href="Aggregation/Club.cpp" target="_blank">Club.cpp</a> and
  <a href="Aggregation/AggregationMain.cpp" target="_blank">AggregationMain.cpp</a>.
</li>

<li>
  In the third example, a Course contains a Room, and a Room contains a Course. The room and course are associated with each other. The course and room 
  each contain a name as well:<br>
  <a href="Association/Name.h" target="_blank">Name.h</a>,
  <a href="Association/Name.cpp" target="_blank">Name.cpp</a>,
  <a href="Association/Course.h" target="_blank">Course.h</a>,
  <a href="Association/Course.cpp" target="_blank">Course.cpp</a>,
  <a href="Association/Room.h" target="_blank">Room.h</a>,
  <a href="Association/Room.cpp" target="_blank">Room.cpp</a> and
  <a href="Association/AssociationMain.cpp" target="_blank">AssociationMain.cpp</a>.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><em>Casts</em></p>
<p>C++ introduces four types of casts.
  <ul>
    <li><b>const_cast</b> can be used to remove or add const to a variable. This can be useful if it is necessary to add/remove constness from a variable.</li>
    <li><b>static_cast</b> is used for the normal/ordinary type conversion. This is also the cast responsible for implicit type coersion
      and can also be called explicitly. You should use it in cases like converting float to int, char to int, etc.</li>
    <li><b>dynamic_cast</b> is used for handling polymorphism. You only need to use it when you're casting to a derived class. This is exclusively to 
      be used in inheritence when you cast from base class to derived class.</li>
    <li><b>reinterpret_cast</b> is the trickiest to use. It is used for reinterpreting bit patterns and is extremely low level. It's used primarily for
      things like turning a raw data bit stream into actual data or storing data in the low bits of an aligned pointer.</li>
</ul>
Code that demonstrates each can be found at:
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="Cast/Cast.cpp" target="_blank">Cast.cpp</a>,
    <a href="ConstCast/ConstCast.cpp" target="_blank">ConstCast.cpp</a>,
    <a href="StaticCast/StaticCast.cpp" target="_blank">StaticCast.cpp</a>,
    <a href="DynamicCast/DynamicCast.cpp" target="_blank">DynamicCast.cpp</a> and
    <a href="ReinterpretCast/ReinterpretCast.cpp" target="_blank">ReinterpretCast.cpp</a>.
  </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><em>Exceptions</em></p>
<p>An exception is a form of software interrupt. They occur when something unusual happens, such as a divide-by-zero, trying to access 
  an array outside of the array bounds, trying to allocate memory when there is no longer any available RAM, etc... What you may 
  not know is that you can intercept this software interrupt in your code using exceptions. You can generate interrupts as well 
  when you detect an unusual situation in your code. The following code generates exceptions for an array out of bounds error 
  as well as a divide-by-zero error:<br>
<a href="Exception/Exception.cpp" target="_blank">Exception.cpp</a>.
</p>


<p><em>Masks</em></p>
<p>C++ masks are used for enabling or disabling features for an object such as a file. Since enable/disable is a binary operation, each feature 
  can be stored in one bit. All features together in one variable is called a <b>mask</b>. Generally speaking, a bit mask allows us to store 
  multiple related values in one variable. For an example on the use of bit-masks, see:
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="SetUnsetBit/Sample.txt" target="_blank">Sample.txt</a> and
    <a href="SetUnsetBit/FileOperations.h" target="_blank">FileOperations.h</a> and
    <a href="SetUnsetBit/SetUnsetBit.cpp" target="_blank">SetUnsetBit.cpp</a>.
  </li>
</ul>
</p>
