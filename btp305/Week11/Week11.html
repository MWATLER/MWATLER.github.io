<h1>Week 11 - The Preprocessor, Multi-Dimensional Arrays</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The preprocessor performs preliminary operations on C and C++ files before they are passed to the compiler. 
  The preprocessor can conditionally compile code, insert files, specify compile-time error messages, 
  and apply machine-specific rules to sections of code. Multi-dimensional arrays can be tricky to use, especially 
  if they are dynamically allocated. We will look at multi-dimensional arrays with code examples.</p>

<h3>Sample Code</h3>

<p><em>The Cube Macro</em></p>

<p>The following code demonstrates how a macro is expanded in-line in the code, and how one has to be careful with macros as opposed to functions:
  <a href="Cubed/Cubed.cpp" target="_blank">Cubed.cpp</a>.
</p>

<p><em>Debug with the PreProcessor</em></p>

<p>We have already looked at embedded debug in week 2 of this course. The embedded debug has been enhanced in this code example to include an enumeration of 
  log levels (LOG_INFO, LOG_WARNING, LOG_ERROR, LOG_CRITICAL) as well as a nested-if inside the Log() macro:<br>
  <a href="PreProcessor/Automobile.h" target="_blank">Automobile.h</a>,
  <a href="PreProcessor/Automobile.cpp" target="_blank">Automobile.cpp</a> and
  <a href="PreProcessor/TravelSimulator.cpp" target="_blank">TravelSimulator.cpp</a>.
</p>

<p><em>Multi-Dimensional Arrays</em></p>

<p>The following code demonstrates a simple 2 dimensional array. It passes through a two-dimensional array to a function which squares all its members. 
  This example also shows passing one row of a 2 dimensional array to cube the members of that row:
  <a href="Array2/Array2.cpp" target="_blank">Array2.cpp</a>.<br>
  The next code demonstates a 3 dimensional array, which, quite frankly, is quite difficult to visualize. The array is passed through to a function which 
  proceeds to square each member of the array:
  <a href="Array3/Array3.cpp" target="_blank">Array3.cpp</a>.<br>
  The following code creates a 2 dimensional array through dynamic memory allocation. The rows represent students, and the columns represent their marks.
  To complicate things, each student has a number of marks. So, the array has to be allocated in one direction first: allocate the number of rows, which 
  represents the number of students. Then the number of marks for each student are used to allocate the number of columns for each student. The array is 
  then passed to a function called <b>CurveMarks()</b> to curve each mark for each student. The code can be seen at: 
  <a href="Array2d/Array2d.cpp" target="_blank">Array2d.cpp</a>.
</p>

<p><em>Two-Dimensional Arrays</em></p>
<p>A tictactoe game has been created from a grid class. The grid class keeps track of the entries on a tictactoe grid. The 
  grid class allows users to make a play, test to see if someone has won, and also to announce a tie game. This example 
  also makes use of class enumerations:<br>
  <a href="TicTacToe/Grid.h" target="_blank">Grid.h</a>,
  <a href="TicTacToe/Grid.cpp" target="_blank">Grid.cpp</a> and
  <a href="TicTacToe/TicTacToeMain.cpp" target="_blank">TicTacToeMain.cpp</a>.
