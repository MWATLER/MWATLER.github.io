<h1>Week 13 - Linked Lists, Review</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This week we will look at linked lists. We will look at the source code for a stack and a queue implemented as lists. We will also look 
  at a custom doubly-linked list based on a Student structure.</p>

<h2>Final Test Review - Coding Question</h2>

<p>The freighter is a cargo ship that carries a collection of items across the ocean such as cars, food, commodities, etc... 
  Various companies pay for the transportation of their items to markets across the world. For the freighter, a piece of cargo 
  should have a certain value ($10000) to make it profitable to carry. Complete the following program by 
  coding the class named <b>Freighter</b> and a global function named <b>calcTotalWorth</b>.</p>
  
  <h3>Freighter Class Requirements</h3>
  
  <p>Your <b>Freighter</b> class includes the following members:
  <ul>
  <li>STL container that holds <b>Cargo</b> objects</li>
  <li>Any other variable you feel is required</li>
  <li>Overloaded += operator that
      <ul>
          <li>Adds a Cargo object to the current object and returns a reference to the current object only 
              if the cargo is not of type Electronics</li>
          <li>If the cargo is of type Electronics, the operator should not change the current 
              object and throws an exception</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Overloaded -= operator that
    <ul>
        <li>Takes a name as argument and removes the first cargo with that name</li>
        <li>If the cargo cannot be found, it prints an error message</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>Overloaded [] operator that
      <ul>
          <li>Takes as an input a value (double)</li>
          <li>Returns the address of the first cargo object that is greater than this value</li>
          <li>If no such cargo exists, the function returns nullptr</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Overloaded [] operator that
    <ul>
        <li>Takes as an input an index (int)</li>
        <li>Returns the address of the cargo object at this index of the Cargo container</li>
        <li>If no such cargo exists, the function returns nullptr</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>A display function that:
      <ul>
          <li>Receives the address of one of the global functions that displays the requested information (byCargoType, byValue, byEverything)</li>
          <li>Displays the total worth of all cargo</li>
          <li>Calculates the total worth of all cargo in three threads. The thread function is <b>calcTotalWorth</b></li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  
  <h3>calcTotalWorth Function Requirements</h3>
  
  <ul>
      <li>The global function <b>calcTotalWorth</b> receives iterators to the beginning and end of a range of 
      <b>Cargo</b> objects.</li>
      <li>This function totals the value of the individual cargo objects</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Other Requirements</h3>
  
  <ul>
      <li>Upgrade the main function of the program to use a smart pointer</li>
      <li>Upgrade the main function to catch any exceptions</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Incomplete Code</h3>

<h2>Final Test Review - Algorithms</h2>

<p><em>Algorithms</em></p>
<p>An exercise with STL algorithms makes use of a list of sprinters whom had set world records in both the 100m and 200m in the same year. Follow the instructions in the file 
  <a href="Algorithms_release/Sprinter.cpp" target="_blank">Sprinter.cpp</a>.</p>
<p>A solution can be seen in the file 
    <a href="Algorithms/Sprinter.cpp" target="_blank">Sprinter.cpp</a>.</p>
  

<h2>Final Test Review - Debugging Question</h2>

<p>Take a look at the code for a picnic basket. There are many errors in the code. Please try to identify them and determine how to fix them. The faulty code can be found at:<br>
  <a href="Debug_release/PicnicBasket.h" target="_blank">PicnicBasket.h</a>,
  <a href="Debug_release/PicnicBasket.cpp" target="_blank">PicnicBasket.cpp</a> and
  <a href="Debug_release/PicnicMain.cpp" target="_blank">PicnicMain.cpp</a>.<br><br>
The identification and resolution of these bugs can be found in:<br>
<a href="Debug_solution/PicnicBasket.h" target="_blank">PicnicBasket.h</a>,
<a href="Debug_solution/PicnicBasket.cpp" target="_blank">PicnicBasket.cpp</a> and
