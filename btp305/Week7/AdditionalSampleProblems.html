    <h1>Additional Practice Problems for Students</h1>
    <p>See below some additional practice problems to help you polish your skill. Solutions are not given.
        The problems below are not an indication of the midterm test question-types or difficulty.</p>

    <h1>Templates</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Create a family of functions (a template function) that checks how many times a certain item appears 
            in an array. The function should return the number of occurrences. Specialize for <b>std::string</b> to check 
            how many times the first letter of a string appears in all strings from in the array.</li>

        <li>Create a family of functions (a template function) that returns how many elements in an array are smaller than 
            a specific value. Specialize for std::string</li> to compare by string length.</li>

        <li>Create a family of functions (a template function) that replaces all elements from an array that have a specific 
            value with another specific value. The value to replace and the new value are received as parameters. Specialize 
            for <b>char*</b> to compare the strings by content; if the new value requires more characters than the old value, 
            raise an exception to inform the client.</li>

        <li>Create a family of functions (a template function) that calculates the sum of all elements from an array received 
            as parameter. Specialize for <b>std::string</b> to concatenate the strings, separated by comma (<b>,</b>).</li>

        <li>Create a family of functions (a template function) that checks if an certain value exists in an array. Both the 
            value and the array are parameters. Specialize for <b>char*</b> to compare the strings by content, not by address.</li>
            
        <li>Create a family of functions (a template function) that counts how many elements in an array match a certain condition. 
            The array and the condition are received as parameters. The condition is a lambda expression.</li>
            
        <li>Create a family of functions (a template function) that counts how many elements of an array are smaller than a certain 
            value and grater than another value. Specialize for <b>char*</b> to compare by string length.</li>
            
        <li>Create a family of functions (a template function) that searches in an array an element that matches a certain predicate. 
            The predicate is received as parameter and is a lambda expression. Return the address of the first element that matches, 
            or null if no match is found.</li>
            
        <li>Create a family of functions (a template function) that returns <b>true</b> if all items in an array received as a parameter match 
            a predicate (also received as a parameter). If at least one item doesn't match, return <b>false</b>.</li>
            
        <li>Create a family of functions (a template function) that finds the second biggest element in an array received as a parameter. 
            If there is no such element (all elements are equal, or the array contains a single element), raise an exception to inform the 
            client. Specialize for <b>char*</b> to compare the strings by content.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A type that uses the templates above must include in its definition certain functions and/or operators. Identify each function 
        and/or operator that your template assumes is de-fined. You may do so in the form of an exact prototype or an English descriptive 
        phrase. To test that you identified all assumptions, create a custom type and make it work with your template (add the special 
        operations and print messages with std::clog so you can trace which one is used).</p>

    <h1>Function Objects</h1>

    <ul>
    <li>Create a functor (a function object) that validates a password. At instantiation, the function object should receive from the client
        <ul>
    <li>a set of characters -> the valid password must contain at least one (i.e., special characters like <b>#!@$%^&*( )</b> );</li>
<li>a set of characters that should not be in the password (i.e., space, new line, etc)</li>
</ul>

Through modifiers, the client should be able to specify if the password must contain at least:
<ul>
    <li>one lowercase letter (by default, yes)</li>
<li>one uppercase letter (by default, yes)</li>
<li>a number (be default, no)</li>
<li>a minimum number of characters (by default, no; if yes, then the client must specify this minimum).</li>
    </ul>
The functor should return true if a password is valid; false otherwise;

<li>Create a functor (a function object) that removes the spaces from the beginning/end of any string. An instance should be able to 
keep track of how many strings were cleared and how many spaces were removed; and provide these values to a client through a query.</li>

<li>Create a functor (a function object) that checks if a string is a valid name. A valid name is a string that contains exactly 2 words, 
    each one starting with an upper case letter. Each instance should remember the last 10 valid strings and the last 10 invalid strings; 
    provide a query to print these strings to the screen.</li>

<li>Create a functor (a function object) that removes duplicates from an array of numbers. At instantiation, the client should be able to 
    specify a numeric value; any two numbers whose difference is smaller than this value are considered the same. The functor will write 
    into a log file the arrays received as parameter, which numbers were found identical and which ones were removed. The functor will 
    count how many numbers were removed and provide a query so the clients can retrieve this counter.</li>

<li>Create a functor (a function object) that checks if a username/password combination is valid. The functor will look into a file (a 
    simulated database) searching for the username/password combination: if it's found, then the function object should return true, 
    false otherwise. Upon instantiation, the client should specify a filename; if the file doesn't exist, the constructor should throw 
    an exception.</li>
    </ul>

<h1>Lambda Expressions</h1>

<ul>
    <li>Create a lambda expression that calculates the sum of an array of numbers received as parameter; return the sum to the client.</li>

<li>Create a lambda expression that trims a string (removes the spaces from beginning/end of the string). The string is received as parameter; 
    the result will be stored in this parameter.</li>

<li>Create a lambda expression that checks if all values from an array of numbers are in the interval <b>[min, max]</b>. The interval is captured by value from the context.</li>

<li>Create a lambda expression that checks if a string contains only lower case letters. Return true if yes, false otherwise.</li>

<li>Create a lambda expression that captures from the context a numeric value, receives as parameter an array of numbers and multiplies 
    each element of the array with the number captured from the context.</li>

<li>Create a lambda expression that encrypts/decrypts a string (encryption = add <b>n</b> to the ASCII code of each character, where <b>n</b> 
    is captured from the context). The client should specify as parameters the string and the type of operation (an enumeration: encrypt/decrypt).</li>
</ul>

<h1>Classes (rule-of-5, type members)</h1>

<ul>
    <li>Create a family of class named Collection (a template class) that manages a dynamically allocated collection of items of any type. The class 
        should support the following operations:
    <ul>
    <li>create an empty collection</li>
    <li>rule-of-5</li>
    <li>add an item</li>
<li>remove an item</li>
<li>retrieve the item at a specified index</li>
<li>modify the item from a specified index</li>
<li>print the content of the collection to screen</li>
<li>remove all items</li>
<li>remove all items that match a certain condition (a lambda expression received from the client as a parameter)</li>
<li>create a new collection that contains only items that match a certain condition (a lambda expression received from the client as a parameter)</li>
    </ul>    
    The class should use exceptions to inform the client when an operation cannot be completed (e.g., bad parameters)</li>
    <li>You are provided with the following code:<br>
        <image src="ShoppingCart.jpg" alt="A Shopping Cart"></image><br><br>
        <image src="ShoppingCartAdditions.jpg" alt="Shopping Cart Additions"></image>

    </li>
</ul>
