<h3>Sample Code</h3>

<p><em>Static Libraries</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>We looked at a <a href="static/MathLib/Makefile" target="_blank">Makefile</a> for building a static library libMath.a from the files
    <a href="static/MathLib/General.cpp" target="_blank">General.cpp</a>,
    <a href="static/MathLib/Geometry.cpp" target="_blank">Geometry.cpp</a>, and
    <a href="static/MathLib/Conversions.cpp" target="_blank">Conversions.cpp</a>.
    This Makefile also had an "install" rule to copy the static library along with the header files to a general place.
    </li>
    <li>We looked at a <a href="static/MathApp/Makefile" target="_blank">Makefile</a> for that links in the static library libMath.a
    with its header files to build MathTest with the following CPP file:
    <a href="static/MathApp/MathTest.cpp" target="_blank">MathTest.cpp</a>.
    </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Shared Libraries</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>This <a href="shared/MathLib/Makefile" target="_blank">Makefile</a>
    creates a shared library from the following files:
    <a href="shared/MathLib/General.cpp" target="_blank">General.cpp</a>,
    <a href="shared/MathLib/Geometry.cpp" target="_blank">Geometry.cpp</a>, and
    <a href="shared/MathLib/Conversions.cpp" target="_blank">Conversions.cpp</a>.
    This Makefile also had an "install" rule to copy the shared library to /usr/local/lib and the header files to a common place.
    <b>ldconfig</b> has to be executed on the command line to tell the system that the shared library is ready for use by everyone.
    </li>
    <li>And this <a href="shared/MathApp/Makefile" target="_blank">Makefile</a> links in a shared library libMath.so
    with its header files to build the MathTest executable with the following CPP file:
    <a href="shared/MathApp/MathTest.cpp" target="_blank">MathTest.cpp</a>.
    </li>
</ul>

<p><em>SDL Graphics Library</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If you would like to have some fun, take a look at some code that uses the SDL graphics library. Before running this code, you have to
    install SDL on your Linux machine. See instructions in <a href="graphics/SDL.txt" target="_blank">SDL.txt</a>.<br>
    The Makefile for the graphics application can be found at <a href="graphics/Makefile" target="_blank">Makefile</a>
    and the source code can be found at <a href="graphics/drawRect.cpp" target="_blank">drawRect.cpp</a>.<br>
    The code uses many concepts not yet covered in this class such as signals, threads and mutexes.
  </li>
</ul>
