<h1>Week 4a - July 26-30</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This week we study threads and mutexes. Threads allow us to perform parallel programming within a process.
    Mutexes provide us with a synchronization mechanism to protect shared resources used by multiple threads.
    We will also look at server design.

<h3>Sample Code</h3>

<p><em>Threads and Mutexes</em></p>
<ul>
    <li>A simple introduction to threads can be found in <a href="thread/counter.cpp" target="_blank">counter.cpp</a>. This program simply starts off 5 threads with a 1 second delay between each. Each thread counts 10 seconds.<br>
        Note that in the <a href="thread/Makefile" target="_blank">Makefile</a> a link to the pthread library is made (LIBS=-lpthread). This is required wherever threads are used in the code.</li>
    <li>For a good discussion of processes vs threads, see the article
        <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/whats-the-diff-programs-processes-and-threads/" target="_blank">What’s the Diff: Programs, Processes, and Threads</a>.</li>
        <li>This week we study threads and mutexes. Mutexing is to ensure our threads are synchronized and operations are atomic.
        <a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/3466/atomic-operation" target="_blank">Atomic</a> operations are the foundation on which other synchronization methods are built,
        they provide instructions that execute atomically, without interruption.  Atomic operators are indivisible instructions.</li>
        <li>Code that demonstrates the need for mutexes can be found in
        <a href="mutex/counterNoMutex.cpp" target="_blank">counterNoMutex.cpp</a>,
        <a href="mutex/counterMutex.cpp" target="_blank">counterMutex.cpp</a>, and
        <a href="mutex/Makefile" target="_blank">Makefile</a>.</li>
        <li>In synchronizing threads with mutexes, one has to avoid thread deadlock.
        <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-system-process-management-deadlock-introduction/" target="_blank">Deadlock</a> is a situation where a set of
        processes are blocked because each process is holding a resource and waiting for another resource acquired by some other process.</li>
        <li>Code that demonstrates deadlock can be found in
        <a href="deadlock/deadlock.cpp" target="_blank">deadlock.cpp</a> and
        <a href="deadlock/Makefile" target="_blank">Makefile</a>.</li>
        <li>Code that demonstrates stream sockets with a separate receive thread for socket reads can be found in
        <a href="clientServer/client1.cpp" target="_blank">client1.cpp</a>,
        <a href="clientServer/server.cpp" target="_blank">server.cpp</a>, and
        <a href="clientServer/Makefile" target="_blank">Makefile</a>.
        Note that common resources are mutexed.
        </li>
        <li>Code that demonstrates INET sockets with a separate receive thread for socket reads can be found in
        <a href="msgServer/msgClient.cpp" target="_blank">msgClient.cpp</a>,
        <a href="msgServer/msgServer.cpp" target="_blank">msgServer.cpp</a>, and
        <a href="msgServer/Makefile" target="_blank">Makefile</a>.
        Note that common resources are mutexed.
        </li>
        <li>A server can act as a message pump or dispatcher if it accepts messages from a number of clients and redirects these messages to a number of clients.
        A client creates a message with the source client information and destination client information embedded in the messsage. The client sends this message
        to a server which redirects it to the destination client.
        Code that demonstrates this message pump or dispatcher using INET sockets with a separate receive thread for socket reads can be found in
        <a href="msgPump/msgClient.cpp" target="_blank">msgClient.cpp</a>,
        <a href="msgPump/msgPump.cpp" target="_blank">msgPump.cpp</a>,
        <a href="msgPump/startClient.sh" target="_blank">startClient.sh</a>,
        <a href="msgPump/stopClient.sh" target="_blank">stopClient.sh</a>, and
        <a href="msgPump/Makefile" target="_blank">Makefile</a>.
        Note that common resources are mutexed.<br>
        For the rationale behind such a central server, see the first six slides of
        <a href="msgPump/Sockets%20and%20the%20Implementation%20of%20a%20World%20Wide%20Messaging%20System.ppt" target="_blank">Sockets and the Implementation of a World Wide Messaging System</a>.
