        I should respond within an hour, but keep in mind I have a class from 1:30pm-3:15pm today.<br>
        The links to the files are seen below. The system consists of an AudioGenerator, an Encoder, and three Decoders.<br>
        The Makefile is
        <a href="../FinalAssessment/Makefile" target="_blank">Makefile</a>.<br>
        A start shell for the Encoder and three Decoders is
        <a href="../FinalAssessment/start.sh" target="_blank">start.sh</a>.The audio generator should be started before executing start.sh.<br>
        A stop shell for the AudioGenerator, Encoder and three Decoders is
        <a href="../FinalAssessment/stop.sh" target="_blank">stop.sh</a>.<br>
        The header files for the assessment are
        <a href="../FinalAssessment/addresses.h" target="_blank">addresses.h</a>,
        <a href="../FinalAssessment/audio.h" target="_blank">audio.h</a>, and
        <a href="../FinalAssessment/sharedMem.h" target="_blank">sharedMem.h</a>.<br>
        The C/C++ files for the assessment are
        <a href="../FinalAssessment/AudioGenerator.cpp" target="_blank">AudioGenerator.cpp</a>,
        <a href="../FinalAssessment/Encoder.cpp" target="_blank">Encoder.cpp</a>, and
        <a href="../FinalAssessment/Decoder.cpp" target="_blank">Decoder.cpp</a>.<br>
        There are six text files which simulate audio 5.1 surround sound and are required for one of the C/C++ files. The six audio channels are
        left, right, center, left surround, right surround, and low frequency effects. The files are:<br>
