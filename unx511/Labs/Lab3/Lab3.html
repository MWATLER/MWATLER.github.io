<h2>UNX511 – Lab 3: I/O Control continued</h2>

<h3>Due: Friday, October 9, 2020</h3>

<p>In this lab you will make use of I/O control (ioctl) and sockets to get information from a network interface.
You will use ioctl’s to retrieve an interface’s MAC address, IP address, netmask, and broadcast address.</p>

<p>Your program will ask you for the name of a network interface. To see the network interfaces on your machine type:<br>
<b>$ ifconfig</b>
</p>

<p>A user interface will give the user the following selections:<br><br>
<b>Choose from the following:<br>
1. Hardware address<br>
2. IP address<br>
3. Network mask<br>
4. Broadcast address<br>
0. Exit<br>
</b>
</p>

<p>A program has already been created that prompts the user for the network interface name, that displays the above user interface,
and that already retrieves a network interface’s MAC address – <a href="etherCtrl.cpp" target="_blank">etherCtrl.cpp</a>.
You need to complete this program to retrieve:<br>
1.	The IP address (case 2),<br>
2.	The Network mask (case 3),<br>
3.	The Broadcast address (case 4).<br>
</p>

<p>Please provide a Makefile for this program.</p>

<p>For documentation on low-level access to Linux network devices, see <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/netdevice.7.html" target="_blank">netdevice</a>.</p>

<p>For documentation on how to get the IP address of a network interface, see
<a href="https://www.includehelp.com/c-programs/get-ip-address-in-linux.aspx" target="_blank">Get IP Address in Linux using C program</a>, from includehelp.com.</p>

<p>Test your program with existing network interfaces on your machine and also with the loopback interface <b>lo</b>.
Compare the results of your program with those given by <b>ifconfig</b>. They should be the same.</p>
