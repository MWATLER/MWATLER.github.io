<h2>DSP912 â€“ Lab 9: Semaphores with Shared Memory</h2>

<h3>Due: Friday, December 11, 2020</h3>

<p>Three processes are going to communicate with each other through shared memory. The memory is allocated as follows:<br>
<b>    struct Memory {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        int            packet_no;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        unsigned short srcClientNo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        unsigned short destClientNo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        char           message[BUF_LEN];<br>
    };</b></p>

<p>Each client is numbered 1, 2, and 3. Each client will read from the shared memory looking for a message for itself. If the destClientNo matches
the client's number, it will print out the message and then send a message to another client.</p>

<p>For example, if client 2 receives a message from client 1, the message could read as:<br>
<b>Client 2 has received a message from client 1:<br>
    This is message 29 from client 1
    </b></p>
<p>Client 2 will then send a message to either client 1 or 3. For example, if client 2 sends a message to client3, the message could read as:<br>
<b>Client 3 has received a message from client 2:<br>
    This is message 28 from client 2
    </b></p>

<p>Since three clients will be accessing shared memory, some sort of synchronization mechanism is required.</p>

<p>Code has been given for clients 1, 2 and 3, plus its Makefile. A start.sh has also been provided to start all processes. They can be found at:<br>
    <a href="start.sh" target="_blank">start.sh</a>,<br>
    <a href="client.h" target="_blank">client.h</a>,<br>
    <a href="client1.cpp" target="_blank">client1.cpp</a>,<br>
    <a href="client2.cpp" target="_blank">client2.cpp</a>,<br>
    <a href="client3.cpp" target="_blank">client3.cpp</a>,<br>
    <a href="Makefile" target="_blank">Makefile</a>.<br>
</p>

<p>This code contains everything except synchronization. It is your task to implement a synchronization mechanism for these three clients,
    such that only one accesses shared memory at a time. Clients 1 and 2 should wait for client 3 to start up.
	You will need to modify client.h, client1.cpp, client2.cpp and client3.cpp.</p>

<p><b>NB:</b> Please insert a sleep of 1 second in the for-next loop for each client, so we can see communication between them.</p>
