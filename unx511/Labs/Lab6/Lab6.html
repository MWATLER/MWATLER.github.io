<h2>DSP912 – Lab 6: Server/Client Communications</h2>

<h3>Due: Friday, March 19, 2021</h3>

<p>In this lab you will create two processes: <b>server</b> and <b>client</b>. They will communicate with each other through a socket connection.
    The relationship of the <b>server</b> to the <b>client</b> is that of a master to a slave. The <b>server</b> will send commands to the <b>client</b>
    and the <b>client</b> will obey and respond. This type of communications is called synchronous, in that the <b>server</b> does not send any more data
    until it has received a response from the <b>client</b>.</p>

<ul>
<li>The <b>server</b> and <b>client</b> will communicate via a socket file <b>/tmp/lab5</b>.</li>
<li>The socket type is <b>AF_UNIX</b>, <b>SOCK_STREAM</b>. The socket family is <b>AF_UNIX</b>.</li>
<li>The <b>client</b> will run inside an infinite while loop whereas the <b>server</b> will send specific commands then quit.</li>
<li>The sequence of commands are as follows:
    <ol>
<li>The <b>server</b> will send the command “<b>Pid</b>” to the <b>client</b> to request the client’s pid.</li>
<li>The <b>client</b> will respond with “<b>This client has pid &lt;pid&gt;</b>”, where &lt;pid&gt; can be obtained from <b>getpid()</b>.</li>
<li>The <b>server</b> will print out the response from the <b>client</b>.</li>
<li>The <b>server</b> will then send the command “<b>Sleep</b>” to the <b>client</b> to request the <b>client</b> to sleep for 5 seconds.</li>
<li>The <b>client</b> will sleep for 5 seconds then respond to the <b>server</b> with “<b>Done</b>”.</li>
<li>When the <b>server</b> receives “<b>Done</b>” from the <b>client</b>, the <b>server</b> will send the command “<b>Quit</b>” to tell the <b>client</b> to shutdown.</li>
<li>The <b>client</b> will break out of its infinite while loop, close the socket connection, then return 0.</li>
<li>The <b>server</b> will close all socket connections, unlink the socket file <b>/tmp/lab5</b>, then return 0.</li>
    </ol>
</li>
<li>Be sure to add error handling in your code.</li>
<li>Please add debug printf’s/cout’s throughout your code to keep track of what your <b>server</b> and <b>client</b> are doing.</li>
<li>A sample run for the <b>server</b> and <b>client</b> are as follows (be sure to run the <b>server</b> first):</li>
</ul>
