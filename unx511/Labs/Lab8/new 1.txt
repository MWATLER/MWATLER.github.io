pause() waits for any signal. You want to wait on SIGUSR1 only. Instead of pause(), the following will work:

    //TODO: Wait for SIGUSR1 - the start signal from the parent
    // pause();
    while(!isRunning) {//Wait for the start signal from the parent
          sleep(0.1);//sleep 100ms
    }

This assumes that your signal handler is set up as:

static void signalHandler(int sig)
{
        switch (sig)
        {
        case SIGUSR1:
                cout << "intfMonitor: is starting up" << endl;
                isRunning = true;
                break;
[...]
       }
}
