<h3>Assignment</h3>
<p>Introduction to <a href="../Assignment1/Assignment1.html" target="_blank">Assignment 1</a> (due August 6).</p>

<h3>Sample Code</h3>
<p>A peripheral writer. A device driver has been written to simulate the control of a peripheral writer. A user level application has been written
  to open, close, write to, read from, and send IOCTL's to this driver. Reference material to parts of the code are embedded within the code.</p>
<p>The Makefile for the kernel level driver can be found at <a href="peripheralWriter/kernel/Makefile" target="_blank">Makefile</a>.<br>
  The source code for the kernel level driver can be found at <a href="peripheralWriter/kernel/peripheralWriter.h" target="_blank">peripheralWriter.h</a>
  and <a href="peripheralWriter/kernel/peripheralWriter.c" target="_blank">peripheralWriter.c</a>.<br> A macro for inserting the module into the kernel
can be found at <a href="peripheralWriter/kernel/load.sh" target="_blank">load.sh</a> and a macro for removing the module from the kernel can be found
at <a href="peripheralWriter/kernel/unload.sh" target="_blank">unload.sh</a>.</p>
<p>The Makefile for the user level application can be found at <a href="peripheralWriter/user/Makefile" target="_blank">Makefile</a>.<br>
  The source code for the user level application can be found at <a href="peripheralWriter/user/userWriter.cpp" target="_blank">userWriter.cpp</a>.</p>
