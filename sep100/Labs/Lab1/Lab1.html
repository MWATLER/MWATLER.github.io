<h2>SEP100 â€“ Lab 1: The Cash Register</h2>

<h3>Due: </h3>

<p>This lab simulates a cash register. The user is prompted for the cost of 3 items. The cash register calculates the total. The cash register
    then gives a report as to how many dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies are required.</p>

<p>This lab will test your ability to retrieve information, perform calculations, and prepare a report.</p>

<p>Your program should be called <b>cashRegister.c</b> and should run as follows:<br><br>
<b>Cash Register<br>
<br>
Enter the cost of item 1: $&lt;cost_item1&gt;<br>
Enter the cost of item 2: $&lt;cost_item2&gt;<br>
Enter the cost of item 3: $&lt;cost_item3&gt;<br>
<br>
The total cost is $&lt;total_cost&gt;<br>
<br>
You used &lt;num_dollars&gt; dollars, &lt;num_quarters&gt; quarters, &lt;num_dimes&gt; dimes, &lt;num_nickels&gt; nickels and &lt;num_cents&gt; pennies.<br></b> 
</p>
<p>In the above sample run, &lt;<b>total_cost</b>&gt;=&lt;<b>cost_item1</b>&gt;+&lt;<b>cost_item2</b>&gt;+&lt;<b>cost_item3</b>&gt;</p>
<p>To obtain &lt;<b>num_dollars</b>&gt;, you have to multiply the &lt;<b>total_cost</b>&gt; by 100, cast the result to an integer, then divide the result by 100.</p>
<p>To obtain &lt;<b>num_quarters</b>&gt;, you have to take the remainder of the above division and divide it by 25.</p>
<p>To obtain &lt;<b>num_dimes</b>&gt;, you have to take the remainder of the above division and divide it by 10.</p>
<p>To obtain &lt;<b>num_nickels</b>&gt;, you have to take the remainder of the above division and divide it by 5.</p>
<p>&lt;<b>num_pennies</b>&gt; is simply the remainder of the above division.</p></b>

<p>A sample run is as follows:<br><br>
<b>    Cash Register<br>
    <br>
    Enter the cost of item 1: $12.50<br>
    Enter the cost of item 2: $13.25<br>
    Enter the cost of item 3: $5.17<br>
    <br>
    The total cost is $30.92<br>
    <br>
    You used 30 dollars, 3 quarters, 1 dimes, 1 nickels and 2 pennies.<br></b>
    </p>

<p>Be sure to document your code with the file name, your name and student number. Add comments throughout the code where necessary.</p>
