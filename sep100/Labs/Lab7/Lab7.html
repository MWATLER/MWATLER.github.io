<h2>SEP100 â€“ Lab 7: Grocery List</h2>

<h3>Due: </h3>

<p>This lab will test your ability to create classes and use objects.</p>

<h3>The Grocery List</h3>

<p>We are going to create a grocery list of grocery items. Each item will have a name, barcode, cost, and whether it is taxable. The tax applied is the HST (currently 13%%). 
   for each grocery item, we will need to set and get all of these, including a function to calculate the taxes (if applicable).</p>
<p>The grocery list will consist of up to 5 grocery items. For each grocery item the program will prompt the user for the name (1 or more strings), the 
    barcode (up to 7 digits, cannot be negative), the cost (must be 0 or greater), and whether it is taxable (Yes/No). Indicate to the user any 
    invalid entries and prompt the user for input again.</p>
<p>Once all grocery items have been entered, the program will print out the name, cost and taxes for each grocery item; and at the end a subtotal, taxes,
    and total. For each grocery item the cost and taxes have to be to two decimal places. The name has to be left justified inside a field of 20 characters.
