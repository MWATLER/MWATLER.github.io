<h1>Week 8 - Functions, Arrays and Data Structures</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This week we will look at functions and data structures. We will look at how we can pass an array of a data structure to a function by value and also by address. 
  We will also look at structures within a structure, as well as file input/output.</p>

<h3>Sample Code</h3>
<p><em>Student Marks</em></p>
<p>We are given a problem where we want to record data for three students at a College. For each student we want to record the name, year of study, marks (up to 6 subjects), number of courses, and average. 
  We want to calculate the average for each student based on the sum of the marks divided by the number of courses. We want to be able to do this by pass-by-value and pass-by-address. At the end,
  we want to calculate the averages for all the students at once.</p>
<p>To resolve the above problem, first we have to find all the nouns/adjectives related to a student and group them in a structure. We see we need the student's name, year of study, an array of marks, 
  the number of subjects, and the student's average. We have to decide the type for each of these variables.</p>
<p>Now we have to find the verbs. We need to calculate a student's average by pass-by-value and pass-by-address. It would make sense to implement these in functions. The first could 
  return the student's average taking in a student structure as argument. The student's average could then be assigned the return value of this function. In the second case where we
  pass a student structure by address, the student's average could be set in the function itself, and the function could return an error status to indicate if everything went well. 
  The third verb is calculating the average for all students. This could be done in a for-next loop where calculate average by address could be called for each student.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The data structure for the student and related function prototypes can be found in <a href="StudentMarks/Student.h" target="_blank">Student.h</a> and the function
    definitions for each student can be found in <a href="StudentMarks/Student.c" target="_blank">Student.c</a>. The main program is
    <a href="StudentMarks/StudentMain.c" target="_blank">StudentMain.c</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Corporate Information</em></p>
<p>A corporation has 12 employees and would like to record data for each one. For each employee it would like to keep track of the employee's name, position, salary and age. In addition to keeping data 
  on its employees, the corporation also wants to record the average salary, the average age, the maximum salary, and which employee has the maximum salary.</p>
<p>The corporation actually stores all its employee data inside a database. For our purposes, the database will be represented by a file <b>EmployeeDB.txt</b>.</p>
<p>First let us find all nouns/adjectives related to an employee. They are the employee's name, position, salary and age. These could be grouped into a structure since they all 
  relate to one thing - the employee. We need a second structure for the corporation itself. It is said to have 12 employees, so the corporation structure should contain an array of 12 
  employee structures, in addition to variables for the average salary, the average age, the maximum salary, and the employee with the maximum salary (which could be represented by 
  an index into the employee array).</p>
<p>Now let us find the verbs. For the corporation we want to know the average salary, the average age, and the maximum salary and who has the maximum salary. We can have three functions 
  perform each of these three tasks. Since the corporation structure contains average salary, average age, the maximum salary, and the index into the employee array of the maximum 
  salary, we can pass our entire corporation structure by address to each of these function so these functions can update these values.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The data structure for the employee can be found in <a href="CorporateInfo/EmployeeInfo.h" target="_blank">EmployeeInfo.h</a>. The employee database can be found in the 
    file <a href="CorporateInfo/EmployeeDB.txt" target="_blank">EmployeeDB.txt</a>.
     The data structure for corporate information and related function prototypes can be found in <a href="CorporateInfo/CorporateInfo.h" target="_blank">CorporateInfo.h</a>
     and the function definitions for the corporation can be found in <a href="CorporateInfo/CorporateInfo.c" target="_blank">CorporateInfo.c</a>. The main program is
