<h1>Week 6 - Design</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Software design is a process to transform user requirements into some suitable form, which helps the programmer in software coding and implementation.
  Software design is the first step in SDLC (Software Design Life Cycle), which moves the concentration from problem domain to solution domain.</p>

<h3>The Product Development Life Cycle</h3>
<p>The software product development life cycle covers a range of activities from the business case to software release.
  See <a href="ProductDevelopment.pdf" target="_blank">The Full Product Life Cycle</a>.</p>
<p><b>The Business Case.</b> A Business Case clearly outlines the fundamental reason for why an organization should engage in a particular
  project or task. They can either be formally or informally presented to top-level management or other relevant stakeholders. The business
  case can also originate from top-level management. Generally, the team creating the business case for a project or task should aim to argue
  that whatever resources (e.g., money, time, talent, etc.) need to be expended for a project are being requested in order to fulfill a business
  necessity. Business Case Development typically includes gather a broad set information about what the project is, what benefits the project
  will bring to the organization, the advantages and disadvantages of going-forward with the project, how much the project will cost and
  potential risks associated with the project as well as those associated with not doing the project.</p>
<p><b>Requirements.</b> A software requirements specification (SRS) is a description of a software system to be developed. It is modeled
  after the business case and fleshes out the functional and non-functional requirements required to fulfill the business case. It may
  include a set of use cases that describe user interactions that the software must provide to the user for perfect interaction.</p>
<p><b>Design.</b> Software design is an iterative process to translate the requirements of the software to a "blueprint" for constructing
  the software. It involves identifying modules in the system, their function and their relationship with other modules. During the design
  process, the requirements of the software are translated to a detailed design of data, architecture, components and interfaces.
  The design process could either be recursive decomposition of modules or recursive grouping of several modules or a combination of both.
  The output of the design phase is a "software design", which ultimately results in software that would meet functional, behavioral and
  quality goals.</p>
<p><b>Implementation.</b> Once the design is complete, most of the major decisions about the system have been made. The goal of the
  implementation or coding phase is to translate the design of the system into code in a given programming language. For a given
  design, the aim of this phase is to implement the design in the best possible manner. The coding phase affects both testing and
  maintenance profoundly. A well written code reduces the testing and maintenance effort. Since the testing and maintenance cost
  of software are much higher than the coding cost, the goal of coding should be to reduce the testing and maintenance effort.
  Hence, during coding the focus should be on developing programs that are easy to write. Simplicity and clarity should be
  strived for, during the coding phase.</p>
<p><b>Testing and Rework.</b> Software Testing is a method to check whether the actual software product matches expected
  requirements and to ensure that software product is defect free. It involves execution of software/system components using
  manual or automated tools to evaluate one or more properties of interest. The purpose of software testing is to identify
  errors, gaps or missing requirements in contrast to actual requirements. Rework in software development is the additional
  effort of redoing a process or activity that was incorrectly implemented in the first instance or due to changes in
  requirements from clients. It usually results from errors, omissions, failures, changes, poor communications and poor coordination.</p>
<p><b>Software Product Release.</b> A release is the distribution of the final version of an application. A software release may be
  either public or private and generally constitutes the initial generation of a new or upgraded application.</p>

<h3>Software Design based on the Use-Case Scenario</h3>
<p>In software engineering, a use case is a list of actions or event steps typically defining the interactions between a role or actor
  and a system to achieve a goal. The actor can be a human or other external system. The three main parts of a use case scenario are
  the use case identifiers and initiators; the steps performed; and the conditions, assumptions, and questions.</p>
<p>We are going to develop a simple method of designing and implementing software based on the use-case scenario.
  We have enough tools in our software development toolbox to perform simple design and implementation.</p>
<ul>
  <li>We want to extract the nouns and adjectives in our scenario. These will probably be our variables. We may want to
    group related variables into data structures.</li>
  <li>We want to extract verbs in our scenario. These will probably be our functions.</li>
  <li>We want to note repetitive action. These will probably be our loops.</li>
  <li>We want to note any decision making. These will probably be our if-else or switch conditions.</li>
  <li>We want to note any calculations. These will probably be our computations.</li>
  <li>We want to note user interation. These will probably be our input/output.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sample Code </h3>
<p><em>Minor Hockey Standings</em></p>
<p>We want to write software that generates the standings for a minor hockey tournament. There are five teams
  and each team will play four games, playing each other once. The team with the most points at the end of
  the tournament wins. If two teams are tied with the most points, those teams will play each other again.<br>
  For each team, the team name, games played, the wins, losses, ties, points and winning percentage will be
  tracked. The points will be generated from the wins (2 points for a win) and ties (1 point for a tie).
  The winning percentage will be points divided by maximum possible points (2 times games played) times 100%.<br>
  The user will be prompted to enter the score for each game by entering the name and goals of the
  first team, then the name and goals of the second team.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Extract the nouns and adjectives. We see <b>name</b>  (char array), <b>games played</b> (int),
    <b>wins</b> (int), <b>losses</b> (int), <b>ties</b> (int), <b>points</b> (int) and <b>winning
    percentage</b> (float). Since these all relate to a team, we can group them under the structure
    <b>Team</b>.</li>
  <li>Extract the verbs. We see the points for each team has to be calculated. Modularize this operation
    with the function <b>CalculatePoints</b>. We see a winning percentage has to be calculated for each
    team. Modularize this operation with the function <b>CalculateWinningPercentage</b>.</li>
  <li>Input/Output operations are required with a user. Prompt the user to enter the results of each game.</li>
  <li>Similar operations have to be performed on each of the five teams. Code this repetitive action with
    a loop that repeats its operations <b>five</b> times.</li>
  <li>At the end of the tournament, the final standings will have to be generated and a winner declared.
    Create a function <b>GenerateStandings</b> to do this work.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Income Tax Software</em></p>
<p>We want to write software that will calculate your income tax based on your income and deductible expenses.
  We want to do this for three people.<br>
  Each person should enter his/her last name, social insurance number, annual income, and zero or more of
  the deductible expenses (charitable donations, number of children under 18, and RRSP contributions).
  From this data the income tax is calculated.<br>
  Deductible expenses are calculated as follows:<br>
  deductible = charitable donations + $1000 x number of children under 18 + 0.22xRRSP contributions.<br>
  Income after deductible is calculated as follows:<br>
  income after deductible = income - deductible<br>
  You are taxed on your income after deductible (IAD) as follows:<br>
  If the IAD is greater than $100,000, taxes = IAD*0.45<br>
  If the IAD is greater than $50,000, taxes = IAD*0.35<br>
  If the IAD is greater than $25,000, taxes = IAD*0.25<br>
  If the IAD is $25,000 or less, taxes = 0<br>
