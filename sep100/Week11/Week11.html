<h3>Sample Code</h3>
<p><em>Dynamic Memory</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Code for student information using static memory can be seen at
    <a href="StudentMarks/Student.h" target="_blank">Student.h</a>,
    <a href="StudentMarks/Student.cpp" target="_blank">Student.cpp</a>, and
    <a href="StudentMarks/StudentMarks.cpp" target="_blank">StudentMarks.cpp</a>.
  </li>
  <li>Code for student information using dynamic memory can be seen at
    <a href="Student2/Student.h" target="_blank">Student.h</a>,
    <a href="Student2/Student.cpp" target="_blank">Student.cpp</a>, and
    <a href="Student2/StudentMarks.cpp" target="_blank">StudentMarks.cpp</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>The <b>*this</b> pointer</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    An exercise with the <b>this</b> pointer has been created to demonstrate the many uses of <b>this</b>. The code contains a customer's name, age, a username, and a password that
    is generated from the username:<br>
    <a href="ThisExercise/Account.h" target="_blank">Account.h</a>,
    <a href="ThisExercise/Account.cpp" target="_blank">Account.cpp</a>,
    <a href="ThisExercise/ThisExercise.cpp" target="_blank">ThisExercise.cpp</a>,
  </li>
  <li>
    A second exercise with the <b>this</b> pointer is built from the first above. The code introduces a <b>destroy</b> function where an object can destroy itself.
    It also introduces a <b>copy</b> function where the data from one object can be "deep-copied" to the data of another object:<br>
    <a href="ThisExercise2/Account.h" target="_blank">Account.h</a>,
    <a href="ThisExercise2/Account.cpp" target="_blank">Account.cpp</a>,
    <a href="ThisExercise2/ThisExercise2.cpp" target="_blank">ThisExercise2.cpp</a>,
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Air Force</em></p>
<ul>
<li>We want to write a program that simulates travel for many planes in an airforce. Each plane has a list of the pilot's names, the amount of fuel in the tank, the fuel capacity 
  which is fixed at 3000L, and the fuel efficiency which is fixed at 2km/L.</li>
<li>Each plane can be created by providing a list of pilot's names and the initial amount of fuel in the tank. Each plane can also be created with no information, but the pilot's
  names can be added later, as well as the amount of fuel in the tank. The plane should travel a given number of kilometres, and indicate whether such a distance is possible.
  The plane should print out a report of the pilot's names and how much fuel is left in the tank. When the plane object is destroyed, it should clean up any dynamic memory allocated.</li>
<li>The main function is going to have an unknown number of planes. Since the number of planes is unknown at compile time, we will have to dynamically allocate the planes at runtime. 
  Also, the main function will prompt the user for the number of pilots for each plane and the name of each pilot. The main function will travel each plane, then give a report. 
  Since the planes were dynamically allocated at runtime, they have to be deallocated before the main function exits.</li>
<li>We clearly have a plane class with related variables and functions which act on them. Since the number of pilots is not known at compile time, we will have to dynamically allocate
  these names at runtime. We will need an array of names, as well as the size of the array.</li>
<li>When travelling, we have to get the range of the aircraft and compare it to the distance we want to travel. If the aircraft has the range, then we will have to calculate 
  the amount of fuel consumed and subtract it from the fuel we have.</li>
<li>A solution for the air force can be seen at:
  <a href="Airforce/Plane.h" target="_blank">Plane.h</a>,
  <a href="Airforce/Plane.cpp" target="_blank">Plane.cpp</a>, and
  <a href="Airforce/AirForceMain.cpp" target="_blank">AirForceMain.cpp</a>.</li>
</ul>
