<h1>Week 3 - Loops, Arrays and Coding Style</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This week we look at loops, arrays and coding style. Three iteration constructs will be studied: while, do-while, and for loops.
  We will look at arrays as a mechanism to store large amounts of data of the same type. We will also study how coding style
  can facilitate the clarity of code.</p>

<h3>Sample Code</h3>
<p><em>Loops</em></p>
<p>Almost all the programming languages provide a concept called loop, which helps in executing one or more statements up to a desired number of times.
  In software engineering, a loop is a programming structure that repeats a sequence of instructions until a specific condition is met.
  Programmers use loops to cycle through values, add sums of numbers, repeat functions, and many other things. Loops are supported by all
  modern programming languages, though their implementations and syntax may differ.
  The C language supports three types of iteration: <b>while</b>, <b>do-while</b>, and <b>for</b> loops. Three instructions control the execution
  of an iteration: an initialization, a test condition, and a change statement. The test condition may be simple or complex.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The following code demonstrates the for, while and do-while loops in C. The initialization, test, and change statements are demonstrated.
  See <a href="Loops/Loops.c" target="_blank">Loops.c</a>.</li>
  <li>Code that calculates an average mark using loops can be found at <a href="AverageMark/AverageMark.c" target="_blank">AverageMark.c</a>.
  The code demonstrates the for, while and do-while loops in C.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Arrays</em></p>
<p>Almost all the programming languages provide a concept called array. An array can store a fixed-size collection of elements of the same
  data type. An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables
  of the same type. Arrays are "lists" of related values. Every value in the array is of the exact same type and only differentiated by the
  position in the array. For example, all the quiz scores for a test could be stored in an array with the single variable name: <b>quiz_scores</b>.
  The first student's quiz score would be found in the first "bucket" of the array, the second students score in the "second" bucket, etc.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A program that calculates an average mark using arrays can be found at <a href="MarksArray/MarksArray.c" target="_blank">MarksArray.c</a>.</li>
  <li>Code that demonstrates a string as an array of characters can be found at <a href="CharArray/CharArray.c" target="_blank">CharArray.c</a>.</li>
  <li>Parallel arrays are arrays that are connected in some way and are used together. Code that uses parallel arrays to track the 
    price and scan-code of items in a grocery store can be found at <a href="ParallelArrays/ParallelArrays.c" target="_blank">ParallelArrays.c</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether you code in C/C++, JavaScript, Python, Java, PHP, Ruby, etc.. to access the first element of the array you will need to refer to <b>array[0]</b>.
  This is often confusing for new developers — why do we start numeration from zero? Wouldn’t <b>array[1]</b> be a more obvious choice for the first item?
  Zero-based numbering comes from language design itself. In C an array points to the location in the memory, so in the expression <b>array[n]</b>, <b>n</b>
  should not be treated as an index, but as an offset from the array’s head. Referencing memory by an address and an offset is represented directly
  in computer hardware on virtually all computer architectures, so this design detail in C makes compilation easier.</p>
