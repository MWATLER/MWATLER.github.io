<h1>Week 13 - Design, Language Standards</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This week we will look at C/C++ language standards. We will also attempt to tie everything together in the design of a student list.</p>

<h3>Sample Code</h3>
<p><em>Student List</em></p>
<p>Let us create a program that reads student data from a CSV file. The file contains the name of a student, the number of subjects, and the mark for each subject. It is not known to the 
  program how many students there are in this file and how many subjects each student is taking.</p>
<p>Each student will have a name, the number of subjects, and an array of marks for each subject. The student will also have an average mark as well as a rank among other students.</p>
<p>The main program will have to open the CSV file and determine how many students are recorded in this file. It will then have to allocate memory for these number of students. It will 
  have to get the name, number of subjects, and the mark for each subject for each student. It will have to calculate the average for each student. After having gone through each student, 
  the main program will print out the information for each student. The program then has to determine the rank for each student. For instance, which student has the highest average, which
  has the next highest average, etc... Then the program prints the students out again sorted by rank, to the screen and also to a sorted file. The output should be formatted such than 
  the averages are printed to 2 decimal places, the ranks are printed inside a field of 2 characters, the names are printed inside a field of 20 characters, and the averages are printed 
  inside a field of 8 characters.</p>
<ul>
  <li>First we identify our class as being of type Student. The student has a name, the number of subjects, the list of marks, the average, and a rank. These should all be represented 
    as variables inside the Student class.</li>
  <li>There are certain actions required on these variables. We need to calculate the average, get the average, set the student's name, set the marks, get the marks, get the 
    number of marks, get the rank, determine the rank, etc...</li>
  <li>For a sample implementation, see
    <a href="StudentList/Student.h" target="_blank">Student.h</a>,
    <a href="StudentList/Student.cpp" target="_blank">Student.cpp</a>, and
    <a href="StudentList/StudentList.cpp" target="_blank">StudentList.cpp</a>.<br>
    This implementation reads the CSV file 
    <a href="StudentList/Students.csv" target="_blank">Students.csv</a> and the resulting sorted file is
    <a href="StudentList/StudentSorted.txt" target="_blank">StudentSorted.txt</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    A sample run looks like:<br>
<pre>
  Eddie Murphy has an average of 71.4
  Teyana Taylor has an average of 84.25
  Wesley Snipes has an average of 75
  Kiki Layne has an average of 67.6667
  Jermaine Fowler has an average of 65.8
  James Earl Jones has an average of 82.6667
  Shari Headley has an average of 85.8
  
  Eddie Murphy has an average of 71.4 and a rank of 5
  Teyana Taylor has an average of 84.25 and a rank of 2
  Wesley Snipes has an average of 75 and a rank of 4
  Kiki Layne has an average of 67.6667 and a rank of 6
  Jermaine Fowler has an average of 65.8 and a rank of 7
  James Earl Jones has an average of 82.6667 and a rank of 3
  Shari Headley has an average of 85.8 and a rank of 1
  
   1       Shari Headley   85.80
   2       Teyana Taylor   84.25
   3    James Earl Jones   82.67
   4       Wesley Snipes   75.00
   5        Eddie Murphy   71.40
   6          Kiki Layne   67.67
   7     Jermaine Fowler   65.80

<p><em>C++ Language Standards</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The C++ language is evolving over time. See <a href="CPlusPlusStandards.png" target="_blank">C++ Standards</a> for a pictoral summary. A more detailed document can be found at 
  <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/history" target="_blank">History of C++</a>.</li>
<li>There are many libraries that extend the functionality of C++.
  For example, Blackberry uses the the <a href="http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/ACE.html" target="_blank">Adaptive Communication Environment</a> (ACE) library
  for concurrent communication software.</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://www.boost.org/" target="_blank">Boost C++ Libraries</a> offers extensions to every part of the C++ library. See the documentation of their latest 
  release <a href="https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_75_0/" target="_blank">Boost 1.75.0 Library Documentation</a> for more information.</li>
<li>For a full list of C++ compatible libraries see <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/links/libs" target="_blank">cppreference - A list of open source C++ libraries</a>. When 
you work in a specialized environment, these libraries become indispensible.</li>
