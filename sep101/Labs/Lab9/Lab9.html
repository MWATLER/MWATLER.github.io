<h2>SEP101 â€“ Lab 9: Card Game</h2>

<h3>Due: Friday, December 3, 2021</h3>

<!--<a href="" target="_blank">Lab Recording (mp4)</a>-->

<p>This lab will test your ability to use the *this pointer and to use dynamic memory.</p>

<h3> Card Game - Twenty One</h3>

<p>You will write a program that simulates a game of 21 with a few twists. The purpose of 21 is to draw cards that sum as closely to 21 without going over. The player with the highest sum 
    without going over 21 wins. In this game however, the players will have the option to steal the cards of other players.</p>

<p>The player has a <b>name</b>, an unknown <b>number of cards</b> with values 1-10 each, and <b>cash</b>. The player will have to allocate the cards once the number of cards is known.</p>

<p>The player <b>creates</b> itself given his/her name.<br>The player <b>draws cards</b> by deleting the cards it has and creating a new list of cards based on the number of cards requested. The value of each 
    card is according to a random number generator that generates a random number from 1 to 10: <b>(rand()%10)+1</b>.<br>The player <b>sums cards</b> by going through the list of cards it has and 
    returning the total points for all of them.<br>The player can <b>add cash</b> given an amount. This amount could be negative (the player lost). If the player has no cash left then <b>add cash</b>
    returns a false, otherwise it returns a true.<br>The player can <b>steal cards</b> from another player. In this case the player has to delete its own cards, copy the cards from the other 
    player, then delete the other player's cards. YOU HAVE TO ADD A TEST SO A PLAYER DOESN'T STEAL CARDS FROM ITSELF.<br>The player can generate a <b>report</b> printing the player's name and
    cash left over.<br>The player can <b>destroy</b> itself by cleaning up any memory allocated.</p>

<p>The file <a href="PlayerMain.cpp" target="_blank">PlayerMain.cpp</a> has been given to test your code.</p>

<p>Sample code on copying, moving and stealing data from one object to another can be seen in an example with a <b>BankAccount</b> class, in the following code:<br>
    <a href="CopyMoveSteal/BankAccount.h" target="_blank">BankAccount.h</a>,
    <a href="CopyMoveSteal/BankAccount.cpp" target="_blank">BankAccount.cpp</a> and
    <a href="CopyMoveSteal/BankAccountMain.cpp" target="_blank">BankAccountMain.cpp</a>.</p>

<h3>Questions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Can you explain the danger when a program allocates memory but forgets to deallocate it?</li>
    <li>For memory reallocation (creating new memory), where is the best place to deallocate memory in relation to its reallocation.
        Should the deallocation be close to the reallocation or far from it and why?</li>
    <li>How did you make use of the *this pointer in the lab?</li>
</ol>
