<h2>SEP101 â€“ Lab 6: Corporate Information Database Access</h2>

<h3>Due: end of week 9</h3>

<p>This lab will test your ability to use structures, arrays and files.</p>

<h3>The Corporate Information</h3>

<p>A corporation maintains a database of employee information consisting of each employee's name, position, salary and age. The corporation wants to also keep track 
    of some basic statistics such as the average salary, the average age, the maximum salary, and which employee has the maximum salary. Code for populating the 
    corporate information structure has already been presented in the lecture of Week 8. Now it is time to add some database access functions.</p>

<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>We want to give the user the ability to perform the following on the database:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Get employee information by employee name</li>
    <li>Get employee information for all employees</li>
    <li>Correct an employee name given the employee name</li>
    <li>Correct an employee age given the employee name</li>
    <li>Change an employee position given the employee name</li>
    <li>Change an employee salary given the employee name</li>
    <li>Commit all changes to the database (write to the file EmployeeDB.txt)</li>
</ol>
<p>The user should also have the choice to exit the program.</p>

<h3>Complete the Code</h3>
<p>The complete code for corporation information has been given to you with eight empty functions. You are to 
    complete these functions based on their prototype and embedded instructions.
    The data structure for the employee can be found in <a href="EmployeeInfo.h" target="_blank">EmployeeInfo.h</a>. The employee database can be found in the 
    file <a href="EmployeeDB.txt" target="_blank">EmployeeDB.txt</a>.
     The data structure for corporate information and related function prototypes can be found in <a href="CorporateInfo.h" target="_blank">CorporateInfo.h</a>
     and the function definitions for the corporation can be found in <a href="CorporateInfo.c" target="_blank">CorporateInfo.c</a>. The main program is
    <a href="CorporateInfoMain.c" target="_blank">CorporateInfoMain.c</a>.<br>
    <b>Complete all eight incomplete functions inside <a href="CorporateInfo.c" target="_blank">CorporateInfo.c</a></b>. Some utility functions have been 
    provided to facilitate data input from the keyboard.</p>

<h3>Sample Run</h3>

<p>A sample run for some user inputs is as follows:<br><br>
<pre>
    The average salary is $85083.33
    The average age is 40.58 years
    The maximum salary is $110000.00.
    This salary belongs to Kumar Swamy, Software Architect, age 44.00.

</p>
<p>Be sure to document your code with the file name, your name and student number. Add comments throughout the code where necessary.</p>

<h3>Questions:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Data members which are related are grouped into a data structure. What about functions that act on that data? Would it be convenient to somehow 
        group functions that act on a data structure with that data structure somehow? Give reasons why or why not.
    </li>
    <li>If you pass an array to a function by address, is it possible for the function to know the length of the array? If not, how could we tell 
        the function the length of the array?
    </li>
    <li>Databases are based on a schema. This is a schematic of how data is stored. What would be the schema for employee information?</li>
</ol>
