<h2>SEP101 - Lab 6: Parsing a Data Stream</h2>

<h3>Due: November 11, 2022</h3>

<p>This lab will test your ability to parse data into a structure.</p>

<h3>The Book Information</h3>

<p>A text file contains information about a set of books. The token for separating information for each book is the colon <b>;</b>.
    There is a separate line for each book entry.
Each book in this text file has a name, an author, a year of publication and a price. Your mission is to extract this information from the file 
and store it somewhere in your program. Once you have completed the extraction, you are to print out information for each of the books.</p>

<h3>Data Format</h3>
<p>Information for each book is stored as follows:<br>
    <b>NAME;AUTHOR;YEAR;PRICE;</b></p>
<p>Note that the book's name and author might consist of many strings.
    The text file containing all book information can be found at 
    <a href="Book.txt" target="_blank">Book.txt</a>.<br><br> The data stored there is:<br>
    <b>In Search of Lost Time;Marcel Proust;1913;17.99;<br>
        Ulysses;James Joyce;1904;21.95;<br>
        Don Quixote;Miguel de Cervantes;1605;21.49;<br>
        One Hundred Years of Solitude;Gabriel Garcia Marquez;1982;28.09;<br>
        The Great Gatsby;F. Scott Fitzgerald;1925;10.99;<br>
        Moby Dick;Herman Melville;1851;6.23
    </b>
    </p>

<h3>Command Line Arguments</h3>
<p>Book.txt must be passed through to your program by command line. Let's say your executable 
    is called BookMain.exe, then BookMain.exe will be invoked from the command line as follows:<br>
    <b>BookMain.exe Book.txt</b><br><br>
Command line arguments are passed through to your program through the main function as follows:<br>
<b>int main(int argc, char* argv[])</b><br><br>
<b>argc</b> is the argument count (which in this case is 2), and argv[] is an array of strings 
representing the arguments (in this case argv[0]="BookMain.exe" and argv[1]="Book.txt").
</p>
<p>In Visual Studio, you can set the command line arguments through the project's properties as follows:
<ul>
    <li>Click on the project name.</li>
    <li>Right click on Properties.</li>
    <li>Click on Configuration Properties, then click on Debugging.</li>
    <li>Look for Command Arguments and enter in the command argument (which in this case is Book.txt)</li>
</ul>

</p>

<h3>Complete the Code</h3>
<p>Three files have been provided for you: 
    <a href="Book.h" target="_blank">Book.h</a>,
    <a href="Book.cpp" target="_blank">Book.cpp</a> and
    <a href="BookMain.cpp" target="_blank">BookMain.cpp</a>.
<ul>
    <li><b>Book.h</b> has some useful constants. You have to create a class or structure of type <b>Book</b>.</li>
    <li><b>Book.cpp</b> has some useful suggestions on how to extract a string from a stream of data. In extracting a string, 
    you are not allowed to use any of the C++ libraries in doing so. You are to use pointers only.</li>
    <li><b>BookMain.cpp</b> has been started for you. Please complete the <b>TODO</b> sections.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Unrelated to this lab is some sample code on how to handle invalid keyboard entries for an integer and double float can be seen at 
    <a href="GetValue/GetValue.c" target="_blank">GetValue.c</a>.</p>

<h3>Sample Run</h3>

<p>A sample run is as follows (be sure to format your output):<br><br>
<pre>
                               BOOK INFORMATION

       In Search of Lost Time             Marcel Proust   1913  $17.99
                      Ulysses               James Joyce   1904  $21.95
                  Don Quixote       Miguel de Cervantes   1605  $21.49
One Hundred Years of Solitude    Gabriel Garcia Marquez   1982  $28.09
             The Great Gatsby       F. Scott Fitzgerald   1925  $10.99

<p>Be sure to document your code with the file name, your name and student number. Add comments throughout the code where necessary.</p>

<p>The solution to a sample problem has been given to assist you with this lab. The scenario is a server that receives a stream of packets from 
    the network, parses the data, and forwards the data on to the destination. The server maintains a list of clients and their IP addresses 
    (more on this next year). It receives a packet that identifies the sender, the destination, the length of the data, and the data itself.
    The server parses this data, then creates a send packet containing the sender, the destination IP address, the length of the data, and
    the data itself. Usually with a server one thread tends to receiving packets and another tends to sending them out. The code can be seen at:<br>
    <a href="Server/Server.h" target="_blank">Server.h</a> and
    <a href="Server/ServerMain.cpp" target="_blank">ServerMain.cpp</a>.
</p>

<p>Another solution to a sample problem has been given to assist you with this lab. The scenario is streaming stock data. A data stream 
    contains the streaming stock price for four companies. The stream contains the company name, the stock symbol, the current price, and 
    the volume. The code extracts this data from the data stream and stores this into a data structure. The information is printed out at 
    the end. The code can be seen at:<br>
    <a href="StockList/CompanyInfo.h" target="_blank">CompanyInfo.h</a> and
    <a href="StockList/CompanyInfo.c" target="_blank">CompanyInfo.c</a>.

<h3>Questions:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>There already exist many useful functions in the C++ input/output libraries for parsing text. Explain how you
        might use them in the scenario presented in this lab.</li>
    <li>This lab presented a stream of data stored in a text file. Can you name 2 other situations where you might have 
        to parse streaming data?</li>
</ol>
