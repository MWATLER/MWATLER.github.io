<h2>SEP101 â€“ Lab 10: Analog Circuit Simulator</h2>

<h3>Due: end of week 13</h3>

<p>This lab will test your ability to write formatted data to a file.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This lab simulates the current through three circuit components connected in parallel. The components are an inductor, a capacitor and a resistor. A sinusoidal 
    voltage is applied to each. The program will write the current through each component to a file. The data written is formatted.</p>

<h3>Analog Circuit Components</h3>
<ol>
    <li><b>The Inductor</b>. An inductor has an inductance in Henries and has current running through it in Amperes. If a voltage is applied to the inductor, 
    the current through the inductor is given as follows:<br>
    current = old_current + voltage * delta_time / inductance.<br>
    So, if a function GetCurrent() was called with the following parameters:<br>
    <b>GetCurrent(double voltage, double timeStep)</b><br>
    The current would be:<br>
    <b>current += voltage * timeStep/inductance</b><br>The function would return <b>current</b>.</li>
    <li><b>The Capacitor</b>. The capacitor has a capacitance in Farads, a current running through it in Amperes, and a voltage stored in it in Volts. If a voltage is 
    applied to the inductor, the current running through the capacitor depends on the voltage stored in the capacitor, the newly applied voltage to the 
    capacitor, the capacitance of the capacitor, and the change in time, as follows:<br>
    current = capacitance * (new_voltage - voltage)/delta_time<br>
    So, if a function GetCurrent() was called with the following parameters:<br>
    <b>GetCurrent(double newVoltage, double timeStep)</b><br>
    The current would be:<br>
    <b>current = capacitance * (newVoltage-voltage)/timeStep</b><br>
    Afterwards, don't forget to update the voltage stored in the capacitor with the new voltage:<br>
    <b>voltage = newVoltage</b><br>
    The function would return <b>current</b>.</li>
    <li><b>The Resistor</b>. The resistor has a resistance in Ohms as well as a current running through it. The current through a resistor is simply 
    the voltage applied across the resistor divided by its resistance. So, if a function GetCurrent() is called with the following parameters:<br>
    GetCurrent(double voltage)<br>
    The current through the resistor is<br>
    <b>current = voltage/resistance</b><br>The function would return <b>current</b>.</li>
</ol>

<h3>The Circuit Simulator</h3>
<p>The <b>main()</b> function in <a href="AnalogCircuit.cpp" target="_blank">AnalogCircuit.cpp</a> runs the analog circuit simulator. Partial code for the simulator is given. 
Use this as a guide to the classes for the inductor, capacitor and resistor.
The voltage is a sinusoidal wave with amplitude 100V. A time step of 0.0001 seconds is given. That is, the voltage at a given time is applied, the time is incremented by this 
time step, then the voltage at this new time is applied again. You are to apply this voltage for each time step to each component then print the results to a file called <b>RLC.dat</b>. 
The results printed will be the time, the voltage applied, the current through the inductor, the current through the capacitor, the current through the resistor, and the total 
current. Each column should be formatted to be 10 spaces wide, and the precision of the results should be to 4 decimal places. The first row will consist of header information 
as follows:<br>
<b>Time</b> <b>Voltage</b> <b>Inductor</b> <b>Capacitor</b> <b>Resistor</b> <b>Total</b><br>
The simulator will run for 0.1 seconds.</p>

<h3>Graphical Representation of Data - Excel</h3>
<p>The Excel spreadsheet can be used to graphically represent text data. Simply go to Excel's <b>Data</b> tab, click on 
    <b>From Text/CSV</b> then load the data. To see the data graphically, click on Excel's <b>Insert</b> tab, then look for 
    the line graph on the <b>Recommended Charts</b> column.</p>

<h3>Questions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>C++ is an ideal language for analog circuit simulation due to its speed. Can you think of any other useful simulation of any kind that could be written in C/C++ or any other language?</li>
    <li>Name three reasons why simulators are very useful?</li>
    <li>The Engineering portion of product development goes through three phases: Design, Implementation, and Rework. In which of these three phases would simulation be most useful?</li>
</ol>
