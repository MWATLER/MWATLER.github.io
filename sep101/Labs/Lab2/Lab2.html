<h2>SEP101 - Lab 2: The Temperature Monitor</h2>

<h3>Due: February 4, 2022</h3>

<a href="https://seneca.sharepoint.com/sites/SEP101ProgrammingFundamentals52/Shared%20Documents/General/Recordings/View%20Only/SEP101%20Programming%20Fundamentals%20-%20Lab-20220126_133125-Meeting%20Recording.mp4?web=1" target="_blank">Wednesday, January 26 (mp4)</a>

<p>This lab monitors temperature for four days. It records the high and low for each day, and validates the entries. At the end, the program prints a report.</p>

<p>This lab will test your ability to store information in arrays and use loops.</p>

<p>Your program should be called <b>tempMonitor.c</b> and should run as follows:
<ul>
    <li>It should prompt the user to enter the high temperature and the low temperature for each day.</li>
    <li>It should validate the entries as follows:
        <ul>
            <li>The high temperature should not be greater than 40.</li>
            <li>The low temperature should not be less than -40.</li>
            <li>The low temperature should not be higher than the high temperature.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>It should record the temperature for four days, using arrays to keep track of the high and low temperatures for each day.</li>
    <li>It should record the highest temperature and the day it occurred.</li>
    <li>It should record the lowest temperature and the day it occurred.</li>
    <li>It should calculate the average high temperature, the average low temperature, and the average temperature overall.</li>
    <li>At the end it should report the following:
        <ul>
            <li>The average low temperature.</li>
            <li>The average high temperature.</li>
            <li>The average temperature.</li>
            <li>The highest temperature and the day it occurred.</li>
            <li>The lowest temperature and the day it occurred.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Sample code that uses arrays with for-loops can be seen at
    <a href="Lab2Sample.c" target="_blank">Lab2Sample.c</a>.
</p>

<p>A sample run is as follows:<br><br><b>
    ---=== SEP Temperature Analyzer ===---<br>
    Enter the high value for day 1: 41<br>
    Enter the low value for day 1: 12<br><br>
    
    Incorrect values, temperatures must be in the range -40 to 40, high must be greater than low.<br><br>
    
    Enter the high value for day 1: 40<br>
    Enter the low value for day 1: 12<br><br>
    
    Enter the high value for day 2: 13<br>
    Enter the low value for day 2: 22<br>
    
    Incorrect values, temperatures must be in the range -40 to 40, high must be greater than low.<br><br>
    
    Enter the high value for day 2: 22<br>
    Enter the low value for day 2: 13<br><br>
    
    Enter the high value for day 3: 34<br>
    Enter the low value for day 3: 0<br><br>
    
    Enter the high value for day 4: 12<br>
    Enter the low value for day 4: -41<br><br>
    
    Incorrect values, temperatures must be in the range -40 to 40, high must be greater than low.<br><br>
    
    Enter the high value for day 4: 12<br>
    Enter the low value for day 4: -3<br><br>
    
    The high temperatures were: 40 22 34 12<br>
    The low temperatures were: 12 13 0 -3<br>
    The average LOW temperature was: 5.50<br>
    The average HIGH temperature was: 27.00<br>
    The average temperature was: 16.25<br>
    The highest temperature was 40, on day 1<br>
    The lowest temperature was -3, on day 4</b>

<h3>Questions:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>What variable type did you use to store your temperatures and why?</li>
    <li>What variable type did you use to store the indices into your arrays and why?</li>
    <li>What variable type did you use to store the averages and why?</li>
    <li>Would you prefer not to use arrays in this scenario?</li>
</ol>
