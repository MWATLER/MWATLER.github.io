<h2>SEP101 â€“ Lab 4: Student Information</h2>

<h3>Due: February 18, 2022</h3>

<a href="https://seneca.sharepoint.com/sites/SEP101ProgrammingFundamentals/Shared%20Documents/General/Recordings/View%20Only/SEP101%20Programming%20Fundamentals%20Lab-20211007_104754-Meeting%20Recording.mp4?web=1" target="_blank">Lab Recording (mp4)</a>

<p>This lab will test your ability to use functions, pointers and structures.</p>

<p>Your program files should be called <b>StudentInfo.c</b> and <b>StudentInfo.h</b>. Skeleton code has been prepared for
    you: <a href="StudentInfo.c" target="_blank">StudentInfo.c</a> and <a href="StudentInfo.h" target="_blank">StudentInfo.h</a>.
    A test file <a href="StudentMain.c" target="_blank">StudentMain.c</a> has been fully written for you and is assumed to be in
    the same directory as <b>StudentInfo.c</b> and <b>StudentInfo.h</b>.</p>
    <p>Your <b>StudentInfo.h</b> should contain the following:<br>
#define MAX_STR 32<br>
#define NUM_SUBJECTS 6<br><br>

//Create struct Subject with members<br>
//name (char array, array size MAX_STR) and<br>
//mark (integer)<br><br><br>


//Create struct StudentInfo with members<br>
//lastName (char array, array size MAX_STR),<br>
//studentId (integer), and <br>
//subject (struct Subject array, array size NUM_SUBJECTS)<br><br><br>


//Create the following function prototypes:<br>
//InitializeInfo - returns void, accepts the address of struct StudentInfo<br>
//AverageMark - returns float, accepts the address of struct Subject<br>
//MaximumMark - returns integer, accepts the address of struct Subject<br>
//MinimumMark - returns integer, accepts the address struct Subject</p><br><br>
<p>Your <b>StudentInfo.c</b> should contain the following:<br>
    #include "StudentInfo.h"<br><br>

    //InitializeInfo - returns void, accepts the address of struct StudentInfo<br>
    //Sets the last name to a null string. This can be accomplished by setting the first character<br>
    //                                     in the last name array to the null terminator '\0'.<br>
    //Sets the student id to 0.<br>
    //Goes through the subject array (NUM_SUBJECTS) and for each subject<br>
    //     sets name to a null string and<br>
    //     sets mark to 0.<br><br><br>
    
    
    //AverageMark - returns float, accepts the address of struct Subject<br>
    //<br>
    //Uses a for-next loop to go through all the marks (up to NUM_SUBJECTS).<br>
    //    Once an invalid mark is reached (mark equals zero), the loop terminates<br>
    //<br>
    //Returns the running total divided by the number of marks.<br><br><br>
    
    
    //MaximumMark - returns integer, accepts the address of struct Subject<br>
    //<br>
    //Uses a for-next loop to go through all the marks (up to NUM_SUBJECTS).<br>
    //    Once an invalid mark is reached (mark equals zero), the loop terminates<br>
    //<br>
    //The index of the maximum mark is returned<br><br><br>
    
    
    //MinimumMark - returns integer, accepts the address struct Subject<br>
    //<br>
    //Uses a for-next loop to go through all the marks (up to NUM_SUBJECTS).<br>
    //    Once an invalid mark is reached (mark equals zero), the loop terminates<br>
    //<br>
    //The index of the minimum mark is returned</p><br><br>
    
    <p>As mentioned, StudentMain.c has been given to you. It will prompt for student Information
        and print out the average mark, the maximum mark, and the minimum mark. Keep in mind
        that the student could be studying up to 6 subjects.
    </p>

<p>Sample code with a cat and cat toys can be found at 
    <a href="Cat/Cat.h" target="_blank">Cat.h</a>,
    <a href="Cat/Cat.c" target="_blank">Cat.c</a> and
    <a href="Cat/CatMain.c" target="_blank">CatMain.c</a>.
</p>

<p>A sample run is as follows:<br><br><b>
Enter the student's last name: Bollinger<br>
Enter the student's id: 111222<br>
Enter the number of subjects: 3<br>
Enter the name of subject 1: Business<br>
Enter the mark for Business: 90<br>
Enter the name of subject 2: Accounting<br>
Enter the mark for Accounting: 78<br>
Enter the name of subject 3: Marketing<br>
Enter the mark for Marketing: 86<br><br>

Bollinger with id 111222 has an average mark of 84.67.<br>
Bollinger's highest mark was 90 in Business.<br>
Bollinger's lowest mark was 78 in Accounting.
</b></p>

<p>Be sure to document your code with the file name, your name and student number. Add comments throughout the code where necessary.</p>

<h3>Questions:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Do you prefer using the functions <b>InitializeInfo</b>, <b>AverageMark</b>, <b>MaximumMark</b>, <b>MinimumMark</b> or would
        you prefer all this code to be a part of the <b>main()</b> function and why?</li>
    <li>Are you comfortable passing variables from <b>main()</b> to the other functions by pass-by-address, or would you prefer these
        variables to have global scope, so they wouldn't have to be passed from <b>main()</b> to any function, and why? Keep in mind
        that if the variables have global scope, they are visible to <b>main</b> and all the other functions.</li>
</ol>
