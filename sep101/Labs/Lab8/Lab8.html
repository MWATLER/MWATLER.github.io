<h2>SEP101 â€“ Lab 8: Gravity</h2>

<h3>Due: April 1, 2022</h3>

<p>This lab will test your ability to create classes, use objects, and use constructors.</p>

<h3>Gravity</h3>

<p>We are going to simulate the displacement of an object on the moon and an object on the earth. For both places, an object will be dropped from 
    a certain altitude with a constant horizontal velocity. Our program will simulate the <b>x</b> and <b>y</b> displacement of the object as a function 
    of time.</p>

<p>The earth object and moon object are similar, with two differences. The earth object will have a gravitational acceleration constant of 9.81 m/s<sup>2</sup> and
the moon a gravitational acceleration constant of 1.625 m/s<sup>2</sup>. The earth object will have no initial vertical speed, but the moon object will.</p>

<p>The earth object will have a gravitational acceleration constant, an initial height, a horizontal speed, an <b>x</b> position and a <b>y</b> position. It can be created 
    through two constructors: one a default constructor and one a constructor which takes as arguments the initial height and the horizontal speed. 
    The earth object will have setter functions to set the initial height and to set the horizontal speed. The setter functions perform validation on the 
    entered values. They will return false if the entered value is less than or equal to 0, true otherwise. The earth 
    object will have getter functions to get the <b>x</b> position (horizontal position) and the <b>y</b> position (vertical position):<br>
    x-position = horizontal speed x time<br>
    y-position = initial height - 0.5 x gravitational constant x time<sup>2</sup>
</p>

<p>The moon object will have a gravitational acceleration constant, an initial height, an initial vertical speed, a horizontal speed, an <b>x</b> position 
    and a <b>y</b> position. It can be created through two constructors: one a default constructor and one a constructor which takes as arguments the initial 
    height, the initial vertical speed, and the horizontal speed. The moon object will have setter functions to set the initial height, the initial 
    vertical speed, and to set the horizontal speed. The setter functions perform validation on the entered values. They will return false if the
    entered value is less than or equal to 0, true otherwise. The moon object will have getter functions to get the <b>x</b> position (horizontal position)
    and the <b>y</b> position (vertical position):<br>
    x-position = horizontal speed x time<br>
    y-position = initial height + initial vertical speed x time - 0.5 x gravitational constant x time<sup>2</sup>
</p>

<p>Part of the <b>main()</b> function has been provided for you in the file <a href="ObjectMain.cpp" target="_blank">ObjectMain.cpp</a>.
    You have to complete the <b>TODO</b> section, where you are to prompt the user to enter new parameters for the moon object and the earth object.
    Be sure to perform validation on the entered values.</p>

<p>For the <b>main()</b> function to work, be sure to put the class declaration for moon inside a file called <b>MoonObject.h</b> and the class 
    declaration for earth inside a file called <b>EarthObject.h</b>. You can put the function definitions for the earth and moon objects 
inside the files <b>MoonObject.cpp</b> and <b>EarthObject.cpp</b>.</p>

<h3>Sample Run</h3>
<pre>
    time:4.516
    The moon object's horizontal position is 451.6m and vertical position is 128.59m
    The earth object's horizontal position is 451.6m and vertical position is -0.0338257m

    Enter the moon object's horizontal speed: 200
    Enter the moon object's initial vertical speed: 5
    Enter the moon object's initial height: 50
    Enter the earth object's horizontal speed: 150
    Enter the earth object's initial height: 300
    
    time:7.821
    The moon object's horizontal position is 1564.2m and vertical position is 39.406m
    The earth object's horizontal position is 1173.15m and vertical position is -0.0292411m

    This sample code simulates a resistor/inductor circuit where the current going through the circuit is given 
    and the voltage drop across the entire circuit has to be calculated.

<h3>Questions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>In this lab the constructor has been overloaded. Do you see any other functions that might require overloading in either class?</li>
    <li>Do you prefer setting class variables by the constructor or by setter functions? Why?</li>
    <li>The class for the moon object and the class for the earth object are so similar. Describe how you could merge both of them into 
        one class called <b>Object</b>.</li>
</ol>
