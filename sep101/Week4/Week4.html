<h1>Week 4 - Data Structures</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This week we study structures. Structures help to organize complicated data by permitting a group of related variables to be treated
  as one whole unit instead of as separate entities. We will also study debugging techniques, for finding errors within our code.</p>

<h3>Sample Code</h3>
<p><em>Structures</em></p>
<p>In C programming, a struct (or structure) is a collection of variables (can be of different types) under a single name. These variables are related to
  each other and are therefore grouped in a structure. Just as we have predefined types such as <b>int</b>'s and </b>float</b>'s in C, a structure is a
  user defined data type.<br>
  Let us say we need to store the data of students like student <b>name</b>, <b>age</b>, <b>address</b>, <b>id</b> etc. One way of doing this would be
  creating a different variable for each attribute. However when you need to store the data of multiple students then in that case, you would need to
  create these several variables again for each student. This is such a big headache to store data in this way.<br>
  We can solve this problem easily by using a structure. We can create a structure that has members for <b>name</b>, <b>age</b>, <b>address</b> and <b>id</b>
  and then we can create the variables of this structure for each student.</p>
<ul>
  <li>We looked at parallel arrays last week. We looked at code tracked the price and scan-code of items in a grocery store as parallel arrays. 
    Since the price and scan-code are related, we can put them into a structure instead. See
    <a href="ProductSku/product.h" target="_blank">product.h</a> and <a href="ProductSku/ProductSku.c" target="_blank">ProductSku.c</a>.</li>
  <li>Data elements related to a book in a library can be stored inside a structure. Elements such as author, title, year, barcode and category are all
    related to a book. Code that creates and uses a Book structure can be found at
    <a href="Library/Biblio.h" target="_blank">Biblio.h</a> and <a href="Library/Library.c" target="_blank">Library.c</a>.
    This example actually shows how an array of structures is laid in RAM as contiguous memory.</li>
  <li>Code that stores employee information into an array of structures for many employees can be found at
    <a href="EmployeeInfo/EmployeeInfo.h" target="_blank">EmployeeInfo.h</a> and <a href="EmployeeInfo/EmployeeInfo.c" target="_blank">EmployeeInfo.c</a>.
    This example shows how to scan and retrieve elements of an array of structures.</li>
  <li>Code that stores student information in an array of structures for many students can be found at
    <a href="StudentInfo/StudentInfo.h" target="_blank">StudentInfo.h</a> and <a href="StudentInfo/Student.c" target="_blank">Student.c</a>.
    This example shows how to scan and retrieve elements of an array of structures, and how to perform mathematical calculations on them.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Debugging</em></p>
<p>Testing and debugging ensure that a program executes successfully for a well-defined range of values.  Such a program might still crash for values outside this
  range. Each program needs to be throughly tested before release to a user community and with each patch to that release.  Compilers identify syntactic
  errors with respect to the rules of the programming language, but cannot readily identify semantic errors; that is, errors in the meaning or intent of
  the code. Walkthroughs and code analysis help identify these errors. During the development cycle (which includes design, implementation, and test and rework)
  expect to spend roughly 40% of your time testing, debugging, and reworking your code.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Look at the following code <a href="DebuggingExample/DebuggingExample.c" target="_blank">DebuggingExample.c</a>. Add breakpoints in this code
    to trace the values of <b>value</b>, <b>count</b>, and <b>runningTotal</b> inside the do-while loop. Trace their values at the end of the program
    as well.</li>
  <li>For <a href="DebuggingExample/DebuggingExample.c" target="_blank">DebuggingExample.c</a>, draw and fill the walkthrough table
    <a href="DebuggingExample/DebuggingExample.docx" target="_blank">DebuggingExample.docx</a> for <b>value</b>, <b>count</b>, and
    <b>runningTotal</b> for a sample run. Compare with the values traced by the breakpoints in this code.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Automobile</em></p>
<p>We wrote code in class for an automobile. We declared a structure <b>Automobile</b> in a header 
  file and defined a variable <b>automobile</b> to be of type <b>struct Autmobile</b>. We got some 
  information from the user and printed it all out. See:
<a href="Automobile/Auto.h" target="_blank">Auto.h</a> and
<a href="Automobile/AutoMain.c" target="_blank">AutoMain.c</a>.
