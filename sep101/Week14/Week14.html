<h3>Sample Code - Debugging Problem</h3>
<p><em>A Bakery</em></p>
<p>A bakery has a name and an address, and up to 64 items. The items each have a name and a cost. Public functions are exposed 
  to create the bakery (a constructor), add an item to the bakery, remove an item from the bakery, get the value of an item given 
  the item's name, get the value of all items in the bakery, and to display all the information about the bakery. The following 
  code has 16 bugs. Identify and fix each:<br>
  <a href="DebugBad/Bakery.h" target="_blank">Bakery.h</a>,
  <a href="DebugBad/Bakery.cpp" target="_blank">Bakery.cpp</a> and
  <a href="DebugBad/BakeryMain.cpp" target="_blank">BakeryMain.cpp</a>.<br><br>
  A solution can be found at:<br>
  <a href="DebugGood/Bakery.h" target="_blank">Bakery.h</a>,
  <a href="DebugGood/Bakery.cpp" target="_blank">Bakery.cpp</a> and
  <a href="DebugGood/BakeryMain.cpp" target="_blank">BakeryMain.cpp</a>.<br><br>
</p>

<h3>Sample Code - Design Problem</h3>
<p><em>Baseball Team</em></p>
<p>The file <a href="BaseballTeam/BaseballTeamDB.txt" target="_blank">BaseballTeamDB.txt</a> contains a database for a baseball team. The fields are separated by a semi-colon <b>;</b> and consist of 
the team name, the wins, losses, and winning percentage (wins/(wins+losses)). The team also has data for each baseball player, of which there are five in total. Each baseball player has a name, number of at-bats, 
number of hits, the batting percentage (hits/at-bats), the batting rank, and the name rank.</p>
<p>The main program is going to load data for a baseball team from the file <a href="BaseballTeam/BaseballTeamDB.txt" target="_blank">BaseballTeamDB.txt</a>. It will display the stats for the 
team and all its players. That is, the team's name, wins, losses, winning percentage, and for each player the player's name, number of at-bats, number of hits, the batting percentage, the batting rank, 
and the name rank.</p>
<p>The main program will then display stats by batting percentage, then alphabetically by name. It will then prompt the user to enter stats for a game that has been played, requesting whether the team won or loss, 
  updating the winning percentage, and getting the number of at-bats and hits for each player. Each player's batting percentage is updated.</p>
<p>The main program will order the players by batting percentage and by name, display the stats for all players, display the stats for all players based on batting percentage, display the 
  stats for all players based on the players' name.</p>
<p>The main program will then save the updated data to the same file <a href="BaseballTeam/BaseballTeamDB.txt" target="_blank">BaseballTeamDB.txt</a>.</p>
<p>The main program will then save the updated data in order of batting percentage to the same file <a href="BaseballTeam/BaseballTeamDB.txt" target="_blank">BaseballTeamDB.txt</a>.</p>
<p>The main program will then save the updated data based on a player's name to the same file <a href="BaseballTeam/BaseballTeamDB.txt" target="_blank">BaseballTeamDB.txt</a>.</p>
<p>Since the file will be overwritten each time, you should put breaks in your program after each file write so you can observe how the program stores the data in the file.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The baseball team class has a name, the number of wins, the number of losses, a winning percentage, a list of players, and the name of the database file. Each of these should be 
    represented by a variable.</li>
  <li>There are actions being performed on the variables of the baseball team class. We need functions to set the filename, to order players, to load stats from a file, to update the 
    stats from the keyboard, to display the stats, to display the stats by batting percentage, to display the stats by player name, to save the stats to a file, to save the stats to 
    a file by batting percentage, to save the stats to a file by player name, etc...</li>
  <li>A sample solution can be implemented as follows:<br>
    <a href="BaseballTeam/BaseballTeam.h" target="_blank">BaseballTeam.h</a>,
    <a href="BaseballTeam/BaseballTeam.cpp" target="_blank">BaseballTeam.cpp</a>, and
    <a href="BaseballTeam/BaseballMain.cpp" target="_blank">BaseballMain.cpp</a>.
  </li>
  <li>A sample run is as follows:<br>
