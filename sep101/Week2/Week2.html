<h3>Sample Code</h3>
<p><em>Types</em></p>
<p>There are many data types in C to accommodate the many types of data required in your programs. C is a typed programming language, that defines
  how to store values in memory and which operations are admissible on those values. We use different types to store different information.</p>
<p>The four most common types in the C language are: <b>char</b>, <b>int</b>, <b>float</b>, and <b>double</b>.</p>
<p>For more details on data types in C, see <a href="Types.docx" target="_blank">Types</a>.</p>
<p>Let us write code to store student information. The data required are the student's last name, the student's identification number, and a list of
  the student's marks.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Code to store and display student information can be found at <a href="StudentInformation.c" target="_blank">StudentInformation.c</a>.</li>
  <li>Be sure to add _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS to your preprocessor definitions. This warning occurs because of our use of scanf() in our standard input/output
    library. Visual Studio prefers we use the C++ version. The preprocessor definitions can be found by right-clicking on
    the project name, then on properties, then on C/C++ Preprocessor. Then click edit on Preprocessor Definitions, then add _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS.</li>
  <li>Another way around this problem is to simply add the following line at the top of your code:<br>
    <b>#define _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS</b></li>
  <li>The best way to deal with this is use the safe versions of these functions, such as <b>scanf_s()</b>.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Computations</em></p>
<p>Let us write code to store and display student information, and to calculate the average mark.</p>
<p>Here we are going to keep track of a running total and the number of marks. The running total will be the sum of all the marks. The average
  is determined by dividing the running total by the number of marks.</p>
<p>For more detail on computations and expressiong in C, see <a href="Computations.docx" target="_blank">Computations</a> and <a href="Expressions.docx" target="_blank">Expressions</a>.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Code to store and display student information including the student's average mark can be found at <a href="StudentAverageMark.c" target="_blank">StudentAverageMark.c</a>.</li>
  <li>Similar code to retrieve student information from a file and write the student's average mark to a file can be found at <a href="StudentAverageMarkFile.c" target="_blank">StudentAverageMarkFile.c</a>
    and <a href="StudentMarks.txt" target="_blank">StudentMarks.txt</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Logic</em></p>
<p>A computer program has the ability to make a decision based on data that it has received. The selection criteria will determine the
  different paths through the set of instructions. It is important to follow the principles of structure programming in coding these
  paths in order to avoid spaghetti code. More detail on selection constructs and structured programming can be found at
  <a href="Logic.docx" target="_blank">Logic</a>.</p>
<p>Let us write code to store and display student information, to calculate the average mark, and to convert each mark into a letter grade.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Code to store and display student information, to represent each mark as a letter grade, and to also display the average can be found at
    <a href="StudentLetterGrade.c" target="_blank">StudentLetterGrade.c</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Decisions can be concrete. In such cases we may wish to employ a switch() statement instead of an if-else construct.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Code to store and display student information, to represent each mark as a letter grade, to display the average and determine the scholarship amount
    can be found at <a href="StudentScholarship.c" target="_blank">StudentScholarship.c</a>.</li>
</ul>
