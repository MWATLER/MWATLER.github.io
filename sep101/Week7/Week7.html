<h3>Midterm Review</h3>
<p><em>UDP Packet Parser</em></p>
<p>Surprisingly, you know enough about C to perform a vital practice in industry, and that is the parsing of a data packet.
  A data packet consists of control information and user data. To be more precise, a data packet consists of meta-data
  (data about the data) and the data itself. We will look at a UDP Packet and parse information from it.</p>

<p>The User Datagram Protocol (UDP protocol) is utilized to send data that doesn't necessarily need to be very 
  reliable. The UDP packet is encapsulated in an IP packet which can be transmitted across a network.
  Both UDP and IP have checksums octets which are used to ensure the data has been transmitted without errors.</p>
  
<p>UDP messages are generally faster than TCP provided that the communication link functions properly. UDP is widely
   utilized to send DNS (Domain Name Search) requests, to exchange chat messages, for streaming audio and video data, etc...</p>

<p>The header for the UDP packet contains data about the data (meta-data). After the header comes the data. The data is "Length" packets long, as indicated by OCTETs 5 and 6 below.
  The format for the UDP packet is as follows:<br>
<pre>
  UDP HEADER FORMAT
  
  OCTET 1, 2	Source Port
  OCTET 3, 4	Destination Port
  OCTET 5, 6	Length
  OCTET 7, 8 	Checksum
  OCTET 9, 10...Data
</pre><br>
The following is a UDP packet where the header is in red and the data in green:<br>
<span style="color:red">04 89 00 35 00 2C AB B4</span> <span style="color:green">00 01 01 00 00 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 04 70 6F 70 64 02 69 78 06 6E 65 74 63 6F 6D 03 63 6F 6D 00 00 01 00 01</span><br><br>
This breaks down as follows:
<pre>
  UDP Header  04 89 00 35 00 2C AB B4
  Data        00 01 01 00 00 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 04 70 6F 70 64 02 69 78 06 6E 65 74 63 6F 6D 03 63 6F 6D 00 00 01 00 01
  
  Source Port       04 89 (04*16*16 + 8*16 + 9*1 = 1161)
  Destination Port  00 35 (3*16 + 5 = 53)
  Length            00 2C (2*16 + 12 = 44)
  Checksum          AB B4 (10*16*16*16 + 11*16*16 + 11*16 + 4 = 43956)
  Data              00 01 01 00 00 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 04 70 6F 70 64 02 69 78 06 6E 65 74 63 6F 6D 03 63 6F 6D 00 00 01 00 01
</pre>
</p>
<p>The overall size of a UDP data packet is limited to 65535 bytes, which means there are 8 bytes set aside for the header, and up to 65535-8 bytes set aside for the data.</p>

<p>To solve the problem of a data parser we need to collect the nouns/adjectives into variables and the verbs into functions. We see that source port, destination port, length,
  checksum, and data are all related, so we can put them all in one structure. Let us call the structure UDPPacket. Now to collect the verbs. There is only one action here, and
  that is to parse the data from a data stream and insert into the UDPPacket structure. Since there is only one action here we can put all the code inside the main() function.</p>

<p>Next we have to decide on the types of the variables inside the UDPPacket Structure. The source port, destination port, length, and checksum can all be <b>unsigned integers</b> since 
  they will all represent positive integral numbers, and the data can be a character array (<b>char[]</b>) of length 65535-8:<br>
<pre>
  #define MAX_LEN 65535//The maximum length of a UDP packet is 65535 bytes
  #define HEADER_LEN 8//The length of the packet header
  
  struct UDPPacket {
    //The meta-data, or header
    unsigned int sourcePort;
    unsigned int destPort;
    unsigned int length;
    unsigned int checksum;
    //The data itself
    unsigned char data[MAX_LEN-HEADER_LEN];
  };
</pre><br>
Now comes the hard part, the parsing! Since each octet in the packet is 8 bits long, we can create a pointer of 8 bits to point to each octet in the UDP Packet stream. This pointer 
could be of type <b>unsigned char</b> and can be used to parse the information. It will start with the high byte of the source port, then the low byte, then the high byte of the destination
port, then the low byte, then the high byte of the length, then the low byte, then the high byte of the checksum, then the low byte. It will then have to go through all the data byte by
byte until it has parsed "Length" bytes of data.</p>

<p>In extracting the source port, destination port, length and checksum, the high byte of each has to be multiplied by 256 (16*16) then added to the low byte in order to extract 
  the number correctly.</p>

<p>Code that does all of this can be seen as follows: <a href="UDPPacket/UDPPacket.h" target="_blank">UDPPacket.h</a> and <a href="UDPPacket/UDPPacket.c" target="_blank">UDPPacket.c</a>.</p>

<p><em>College Ratings</em></p>
<p>One thing high school graduates wonder is whether it is worth paying a lot of tuition to attend a particular higher learning institution. One thing that can be checked 
  is the employer satisfaction rating for a particular College or University. If one divides the employer satisfaction by the tuition, one can come up with a ratio to 
  determine where might be the best place to study for the cost.</p>

<p>We are going to write a program that collects information for Colleges, which will request the College name, tuition, and employer satisfaction. We need to calculate the 
  satisfaction to tuition ratio for each College.</p>

<p>First we collect the nouns and adjective. The college name, tuition, and employer satisfaction are all variables that relate to a College, so we could put them 
  into a college information structure:<br>
  <pre>
#define MAX_STR 256

struct CollegeInfo {
	char name[MAX_STR];
	double tuition;
	double employerSatisfaction;//Choose a variable name that represents what it is
};
  </pre>
</p>

<p>Then we collect the verbs. For each college a satisfaction to tuition ratio has to be calculated, and the College with the best ratio has to be noted. We can 
  create a function that accepts College information as input, and returns the satisfaction to tuition ratio. We can do this two ways. The function can accept 
college information as input, and return the ratio as an output. But how to we show if data is invalid? The function could therefore accept college information 
as pass by value, the ratio as pass-by-address where we will store the result, and the function could return a boolean to indicate valid data or not. The function 
prototype could therefore look as follows:<br>
<pre>
bool GetRatio(struct CollegeInfo coll, double* ratio);
</pre>
Note that since we are not changing anything inside the structure CollegeInfo, it is passed by value. Since ratio is the output, that variable is passed by address.</p>
