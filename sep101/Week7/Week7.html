<h3>Midterm Review</h3>

<p><em>College Rankings</em></p>
<p>One thing high school graduates wonder is whether it is worth paying a lot of tuition to attend a particular higher learning institution. One thing that can be checked 
  is the employer satisfaction rating for a particular college or university. If one divides the employer satisfaction by the tuition, one can come up with a ratio to 
  determine where might be the best place to study for the cost.</p>

<p>We are going to write a program that collects information for five colleges, which will request the college name, address, tuition, and employer satisfaction for each. 
  We need to calculate the satisfaction to tuition ratio for each college and determine that college's ranking among other colleges.</p>

<p>First we collect the nouns and adjective. The college name, address, tuition, and employer satisfaction are all variables that relate to a college, so do the satisfaction to 
  tuition ratio and the college's ranking, so we could put them into a college structure:<br>
  <pre>
    #define MAX_STR 64

    struct College {
      char name[MAX_STR];
      char address[MAX_STR];
      double tuition;
      double employerSatisfaction;
      double satisfactionToTuitionRatio;
      int ranking;
    };  </pre>
</p>

<p>Then we collect the verbs. For each college a satisfaction to tuition ratio has to be calculated, and this ratio can be used to determine the rankings 
  of the colleges. We can create a function that accepts College information as input, and calculates the satisfaction to tuition ratio. We can do this two ways. The function can accept 
college information as input, and return the ratio as an output. But how to we show if data is invalid? The function could therefore accept college information 
as pass by address, calculate and set the satisfaction to tuition ratio, and the function could return an int to indicate valid data or not. The function 
prototype could therefore look as follows:<br>
<pre>
int GetRatio(struct CollegeInfo* college);
</pre>
Note that since we are changing one of the variables of structure College, it is passed by address.<br>
You might consider a function to determine rankings. This function would have to take the entire array of 
Colleges in order to compare the colleges against each other.</p>

<p>We have to consider the user in this example. Since you will be accepting user input, and some of that input might require scanning to the end of a line, you might want to add 
  a utility function that deletes all garbage characters from the input buffer:<br>
<pre>
  void utilClearInputBuffer() {
    while (getchar() != '\n');
  }
</pre>
Also, we might want to create a PrintReport() function that prints a report for each college. This function would take a College structure by value 
than by address, since no changes will be made to any object of type struct College.</p>

  <p><em>Travel Simulator</em></p>
  <p>You have been given information about four cars.<br>
    The first is a grey 2013 Toyota Corolla which has a fuel efficiency in the city of 8.2L/100km and a fuel efficiency on the highway of 6.2L/100km.<br> 
    The second is a red 2012 Honda Civic which has a fuel efficiency in the city of 7.8L/100km and a fuel efficiency on the highway of 5.8L/100km.<br> 
    The third is a blue 2008 Chevrolet Impala which has a fuel efficiency in the city of 10.6L/100km and a fuel efficiency on the highway of 7.5L/100km.<br> 
    The fourth is a black 2016 Cadillac Escalade which has a fuel efficiency in the city of 17.29L/100km and a fuel efficiency on the highway of 12.5L/100km.</p>

<p>You'd like to take these cars for a drive to see how much fuel they consume. Fuel consumption as a function of distance travelled can be 
  calculated as follows:<br>
  <b>fuelConsumed = fuelEfficiency/100 * distance</b><br><br>
  You and three others have decided to simulate travel with these cars by tanking these cars to 50L of fuel, driving them 200km in the city, then 300km on the highway. If fuel runs out in 
  any of them, print out a warning message.</p>

<p>At the end, your program should print out a report for each, displaying the colour, year, make and model for each, as well as the 
  fuel remaining in the tank.</p>

<p>I leave you to work out any required data structures, functions, and user input/output. A solution can be found at
  <a href="TravelSimulator/Automobile.h" target="_blank">Automobile.h</a>,

<p><em>Student Marks</em></p>
<p>We are given a problem where we want to record data for three students at a College. For each student we want to record the name, year of study, marks (up to 6 subjects), number of courses, and average. 
  We want to calculate the average for each student based on the sum of the marks divided by the number of courses. We want to be able to do this by pass-by-value and pass-by-address. At the end,
  we want to calculate the averages for all the students at once.</p>
<p>To resolve the above problem, first we have to find all the nouns/adjectives related to a student and group them in a structure. We see we need the student's name, year of study, an array of marks, 
  the number of subjects, and the student's average. We have to decide the type for each of these variables.</p>
<p>Now we have to find the verbs. We need to calculate a student's average by pass-by-value and pass-by-address. It would make sense to implement these in functions. The first could 
  return the student's average taking in a student structure as argument. The student's average could then be assigned the return value of this function. In the second case where we
  pass a student structure by address, the student's average could be set in the function itself, and the function could return an error status to indicate if everything went well. 
  The third verb is calculating the average for all students. This could be done in a for-next loop where calculate average by address could be called for each student.</p>

  <li>The data structure for the student and related function prototypes can be found in <a href="StudentMarks/Student.h" target="_blank">Student.h</a> and the function
    definitions for each student can be found in <a href="StudentMarks/Student.c" target="_blank">Student.c</a>. The main program is

<h3>Sample Code for Assignment 1</h3>
<p><em>The Header Guard</em></p>
<p>Sometimes the including of header files can become quite unwieldy. A header file can be included 
  in more than one place in your program and lead to redefinition errors. To overcome this, it is common 
  to include a header guard around your header files. This ensures that the compiler sees the header 
  file only once during compilation. See the file <b>Common.h</b> in the following example for an example 
  of using a header file:<br>
  <a href="HeaderGuard/Common.h" target="_blank">Common.h</a>, 
  <a href="HeaderGuard/Student.h" target="_blank">Student.h</a>, 
  <a href="HeaderGuard/Student.c" target="_blank">Student.c</a>, 
  <a href="HeaderGuard/Teacher.h" target="_blank">Teacher.h</a>, 
  <a href="HeaderGuard/Teacher.c" target="_blank">Teacher.c</a>, 
  <a href="HeaderGuard/Error.c" target="_blank">Error.c</a> and
  <a href="HeaderGuard/InfoMain.c" target="_blank">InfoMain.c</a>.
</p>

<p><em>The Bookstore</em></p>
<p>Some more sample code that might assist you with assignment 1 is the <b>bookstore</b>. The bookstore has a name and an address. It also contains four books and five DVDs.
Each book has a name, author, purchase price, and sale price. Each DVD has a name, artist, purchase price, and sale price. All information for the bookstore is 
retrieved from a file. The user is prompted for the name of the file.</p>
<p>We want to know the net worth of the bookstore, which will be a sum of the sale prices for all items (books and DVDs). We want to know the profits of the bookstore 
  which is a sum of sale price minus purchase price for all items. We want to know the profits by books only, and by DVDs only. Finally, we want to be able to change 
  the price of any item. The user inputs the name of the item.</p>
