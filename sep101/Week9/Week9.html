<h1>Week 9 - Object Oriented Programming</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This week we will look at object oriented programming. We will design classes, and we will distinguish between a 
  class and an object of a class.</p>

<h3>Namespaces</h3>
<p>One of the first steps to object oriented programming is the <b>namespace</b>. The <b>namespace</b> is present in C++ but not in C. Object oriented 
  programming leads to modular programming, and there are cases where classes, structures, functions or variables from different modules may have to be
  differentiated from each other. For example, you might be writing some code that has a function called <b>xyz()</b> and there is another library 
  or module available which also has a function called <b>xyz()</b>. Now the compiler has no way of knowing which version of the <b>xyz()</b> function
  you are referring to within your code.</p>

<p>A namespace is designed to overcome this difficulty and is used as additional information to differentiate similar functions, classes, variables etc.
  with the same name available in different libraries. Using namespace, you can define the context in which names are defined. In essence, a namespace
  defines a scope. See <b>Namespaces</b> under Sample Code for a simple example.</p>

<h3>Object Oriented Programming</h3>
<p>We have looked at many examples where we group variables that are related to each other into structures. You may have noticed that there are functions 
  in this sample code that act on the data in these structures. For example, the income tax program from week 6 collected personal data into the structure 
  <b>Person</b>. There were functions that operated on the data in this structure to calculate the deductible and to calculate the income tax:<br>
  <b>void CalculateDeductible(struct Person* person);<br>
    void CalculateIncomeTax(struct Person* person);</b><br>
  The code from week 6 can be found at <a href="../Week6/IncomeTax/IncomeTax.h" target="_blank">IncomeTax.h</a>
  and <a href="../Week6/IncomeTax/IncomeTax.c" target="_blank">IncomeTax.c</a>.</p>
<p>What if we collected variables that are related to each other, and functions that operate on those variables, together. For instance, what if 
  we collected the structure <b>Person</b> with the functions <b>CalculateDeductible()</b> and <b>CalculateIncomeTax</b>! Related variables, and 
  functions which act on those variables, can be collected into something called a <b>class</b>. These functions have access to all the variables 
  of the <b>class</b> and these variables no longer have to be passed through as an argument to these functions. See <b>Income Tax</b> under 
  Sample Code for a code example.</p>
<p>A <b>class</b> is therefore a collection of related variables along with functions that operate on them. A <b>class</b> is a blueprint, or a user 
defined type, similar to a structure. An instance of a <b>class</b> is an <b>object</b>. Please see 
<a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.pptx" target="_blank">ObjectOrientedProgramming.pptx</a> for an introduction to object oriented programming. See 
the <b>Travel Simulator</b> under Sample Code for the code for the travel simulator introduced in the powerpoint document.

<h3>Sample Code</h3>
<p><em>Namespaces</em></p>
<p>A brief introduction to namespaces is demonstrated in the following code:<br>
  <a href="Namespace/namespace.cpp" target="_blank">namespace.cpp</a> and
  <a href="Namespace/namespaceFrench.cpp" target="_blank">namespaceFrench.cpp</a>.
</p>

<p><em>Travel Simulator</em></p>
<p>Code for the travel simulator introduced in <a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.pptx" target="_blank">ObjectOrientedProgramming.pptx</a> can be found here:<br>
  <a href="TravelSimulator/Automobile.h" target="_blank">Automobile.h</a>,
  <a href="TravelSimulator/Automobile.cpp" target="_blank">Automobile.cpp</a> and
  <a href="TravelSimulator/TravelSimulator.cpp" target="_blank">TravelSimulator.cpp</a>.<br>
  The code for the travel simulator uses constructors. We will look at them later.
</p>

<p><em>Income Tax</em></p>
<p>Let us look at our income tax program from week 6. In this example the structure <b>Person</b> is replaced by the class <b>Person</b>. The class 
<b>Person</b> includes the variables of the structure <b>Person</b> plus functions which operate on these variables.<br>
<a href="IncomeTax/IncomeTax.h" target="_blank">IncomeTax.h</a>,
<a href="IncomeTax/IncomeTax.cpp" target="_blank">IncomeTax.cpp</a> and
<a href="IncomeTax/IncomeTaxMain.cpp" target="_blank">IncomeTaxMain.cpp</a>.<br></p>

<p><em>Student Marks</em></p>
<p>Let us look at our student marks program from week 8. If you look at the week 8 code you will find a structure <b>Student</b> consisting 
of variables related to a student. You will also find the functions <b>CalculateAveragePassByValue</b>, <b>CalculateAveragePassByAddress</b>
and <b>CalculateAverages</b>. All functions that operate on the variables inside the structure <b>Student</b> have now been placed inside 
a class called <b>Student</b>. See the sample code below:<br>
<a href="StudentMarks/Student.h" target="_blank">Student.h</a>,
<a href="StudentMarks/Student.cpp" target="_blank">Student.cpp</a> and
<a href="StudentMarks/StudentMain.cpp" target="_blank">StudentMain.cpp</a>.<br></p>
