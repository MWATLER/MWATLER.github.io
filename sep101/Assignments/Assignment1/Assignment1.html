<h4><b><u>Business Case</u></b> (Marketing, Project Manager, Senior Executives)</h4>
<p>A real estate company invests in three types of real estate and it wishes to know the performance for each. The types of real estate are
    1)apartments, 2)townhouses, and 3)semi-detached houses. The real estate company buys these and rents them out.</p>


<h4><b><u>Requirements</u></b> (Marketing, Project Manager, Project Lead)</h4>
<p>For apartments, townhouses, and semi-detached houses, the real estate company wants the following information for each:</p>
<ol>
    <li>The monthly earnings</li>
    <li>The return on investment</li>
    <li>The estimated current value</li>
    <li>The capital gains</li>
</ol>

<h4><b><u>Design</u></b> (Project Lead, Senior Engineers)</h4>

<b>The Real Estate Company</b><br>
<p>The <b>real estate company</b> has a name, an address, 5 apartments, 5 townhouses, and 5 semi-detached houses.</p>
<ol>
<li>To determine the performance of the 5 apartments:
<ul>
    <li>Monthly earnings, apartment: sum the monthly earnings for each apartment.</li>
    <li>Return on investment, apartment: sum the return on investment for each apartment.</li>
    <li>Current value, apartment: sum the current value for each apartment.</li>
    <li>Capital gains, apartment: sum the capital gains for each apartment.</li>
</ul></li><br>
<li>To determine the performance of the 5 townhouses:
<ul>
    <li>Monthly earnings, townhouse: sum the monthly earnings for each townhouse.</li>
    <li>Return on investment, townhouse: sum the return on investment for each townhouse.</li>
    <li>Current value, townhouse: sum the current value for each townhouse.</li>
    <li>Capital gains, townhouse: sum the capital gains for each townhouse.</li>
</ul></li><br>
<li>To determine the performance of the 5 semi-detached houses:
<ul>
    <li>Monthly earnings, semi-detached: sum the monthly earnings for each semi-detached house.</li>
    <li>Return on investment, semi-detached: sum the return on investment for each semi-detached house.</li>
    <li>Current value, semi-detached: sum the current value for each semi-detached house.</li>
    <li>Capital gains, semi-detached: sum the capital gains for each semi-detached house.</li>
</ul></li><br>
</ol>

<b>The Real Estate Types</b><br>
<ol>
<li>Each <b>apartment</b> has an address, a number of rooms, a number of bathrooms, a purchase price, monthly rent, monthly condo fees, monthly earnings, annual return on 
    investment, current value, and capital gains.<br>To determing the performance of each apartment:
<ul>
    <li>monthly earnings = monthly rent - monthly condo fees.</li>
    <li>return on investment (percent) = 100 x 12 x monthly earnings / purchase price.</li>
    <li>current value = 12 x monthly earnings / interest rate. The interest rate is hard-coded to 5% (or 0.05).</li>
    <li>capital gains = current value - purchase price.</li>
</ul><br>
<li>Each <b>townhouse</b> has an address, a number of rooms, a number of bathrooms, a purchase price, monthly rent, monthly utilities, monthly condo fees, monthly property tax, 
    monthly earnings, annual return on investment, current value, and capital gains.<br>To determing the performance of each townhouse:
<ul>
    <li>monthly earnings = monthly rent - monthly utilities - monthly condo fees - monthly property tax.</li>
    <li>return on investment (percent) = 100 x 12 x monthly earnings / purchase price.</li>
    <li>current value = 12 x monthly earnings / interest rate. The interest rate is hard-coded to 5% (or 0.05).</li>
    <li>capital gains = current value - purchase price.</li>
</ul><br>
<li>Each <b>semi-detached house</b> has an address, a number of rooms, a number of bathrooms, a purchase price, monthly rent, monthly utilities, monthly property tax, 
    monthly earnings, annual return on investment, current value, and capital gains.<br>To determing the performance of each semi-detached house:
<ul>
    <li>monthly earnings = monthly rent - monthly utilities - monthly property tax.</li>
    <li>return on investment (percent) = 100 x 12 x monthly earnings / purchase price.</li>
    <li>current value = 12 x monthly earnings / interest rate. The interest rate is hard-coded to 5% (or 0.05).</li>
    <li>capital gains = current value - purchase price.</li>
</ul>
</ol>

You will have to copy the extracted data directly to your data structures.

<h4><b><u>Questions</u></b></h4>
<p>You will notice as you work through this assignment that you have data structures and you have functions that operate on these data structures.</p>
<ol>
    <li>For the apartment, there is a structure of related variables and there are functions which operate on these variables. Write the class declaration 
        for an apartment based on the apartment structure and functions which operate on the apartment structure.</li>
    <li>For the townhouse, there is a structure of related variables and there are functions which operate on these variables. Write the class declaration
