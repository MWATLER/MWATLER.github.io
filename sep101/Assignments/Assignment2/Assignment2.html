<h4><b><u>Abstract</u></b></h4>
<p>With advances in nuclear technology, it is now possible to generate anti-matter particles from the collision of light. We therefore need a feasibility study 
    to understand the limitations of many types of anti-matter driven spacecraft as they travel together through space, even though the practical realization
    of such a study may be one or two generations away.</p>

<h4><b><u>Introduction</u></b></h4>
<p>Recent research has shown that photons, or high energy light, can be compelled to collide generating matter/anti-matter pairs of particles. The particles
    generated are the electon (matter) and the positron (anti-matter version of the electron). In order to keep these particles from colliding, magnetic fields
    are used to separate them into separate magnetic bottles. After large quantitues have been stored, they can then be brought to collide in a controlled way
    to generate enormous amounts of energy according to Einstein's equation E=mc<sup>2</sup>. Such a collision of electrons and positrons will result in gamma
    rays. Currently there is no known material that can reflect gamma rays. It is assumed such a material will be developed in the future, so these rays will
    reflect off this material and propel the spaceship forward.</p>

<h4><b><u>Materials and Methods</u></b></h4>
<p>There are three types of spaceships: a cargo vessel, a starship, and a warbird. Each of these carries a payload and a propulsion system. The warbird
    and starship also carry a weapons system. The mass of each spaceship has to be determined in order to calculate the energy required to accelerate 
    a spaceship to a certain velocity, according to the equation for kinetic energy: E=0.5mv<sup>2</sup>. Knowing the energy required to accelerate a 
    spaceship to a certain velocity, the amount of matter/anti-matter annihilation required to generate such energy (assuming 100% efficiency) can be
    calculate from E=mc<sup>2</sup>, m=E/c<sup>2</sup>. Furthermore, since these spaceships are traveling through space, they have the ability to 
    generate their own matter/anti-matter from the level of light around them.</p>

<h4><b><u>Design - The Components of a Space Ship</u></b></h4>
<ol>
    <li><b>The Payload</b>. The payload consists of the following masses:

<h4><b><u>Testing and Rework</u></b></h4>
<p><b>StarFleet.cpp</b>. The program <a href="StarFleet.cpp" target="_blank">StarFleet.cpp</a> contains the main() function and will test your system. It consists of a warbird,
starship, and two cargo ships. Essential parameters are passed through in the construction of each spaceship. StarFleet.cpp will accelerate your ships by 0.01 the speed of
light and will determine if all our ships can keep up. During the travel, fuel is generated. A report for all ships is generated. The program will then accelerate our ships
by another 0.005 times the speed of light and will determine if all our ships can keep up. During the travel, fuel is generated. A report is generated. The program will once
again accelerate our ships by another 0.005 times the speed of light and will determine if all our ships can keep up. During the travel, fuel is generated. A report is 
generated. The ships will then engage in combat. The warbird fires torpedoes and laser cannons, and the starship fires laser cannons. A report is generated.</p>
<p>A run of the test program StarFleet.cpp should provide the following output:

<h4><b><u>Questions</u></b></h4>
<ol>
    <li>Given that the nearest star-system is 4.0 light years away, based on this study how long do you think it would take a warbird to get there from earth?</li>
    <li>Do you think you could perform this assignment with just structures? Explain.</li>
    <li>Do you think you could perform this assignment without classes or structures? Explain.</li>
    <li>Would it be easy to present the cargo ship, starhip, and warbird as black boxes for another programmer to use? Explain.</li>
</ol>
