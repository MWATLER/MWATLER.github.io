<h1>Week 5 - Functions and Pointers</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This week we study functions and pointers. We will study function parameters that are pass-by-value and pass-by-address. We will also look
  at pointing to the memory location of variables.</p>

<h3>Sample Code</h3>
<p><em>Functions</em></p>
<p>A function is a group of statements that together perform a task. Every C program has at least one function, which is <b>main()</b>,
  and all the most trivial programs can define additional functions.<br>

  You can divide up your code into separate functions. How you divide up your code among different functions is up to you,
  but logically the division is such that each function performs a specific task.<br>
  
  A function declaration or prototype tells the compiler about a function's <b>name</b>, <b>return type</b>, and <b>parameters</b>.
  A function definition provides the actual body of the function.<br>
  
  The C standard library provides numerous built-in functions that your program can call. For example, printf() to perform formatted printing is a function.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Code that encapsulates some math features into functions can be found at
    <a href="Math/Math.h" target="_blank">Math.h</a> and <a href="Math/Math.c" target="_blank">Math.c</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Pointers</em></p>
<p>When a variable is declared, the memory needed to store its value is assigned a specific location in memory (its memory address).
  Generally, C/C++ programs do not actively decide the exact memory addresses where its variables are stored. Fortunately, that task
  is left to the operating system that decides the particular memory locations on runtime. However, it may be useful for a program to
  be able to obtain the address of a variable during runtime in order to access to its data or to data cells that are at a certain
  position relative to it.<br>
  A pointer is a variable that stores the address of another variable. Unlike other variables that hold values of a certain type,
  pointer holds the address of a variable. For example, an integer variable holds (or you can say stores) an integer value, however
  an integer pointer holds the address of a integer variable.<br>
  In C/C++ you are not limited to pointing to the address of a variable. You can also point to the starting address of a function.
  Passing the addresses of variables or functions allows code which would normally be out of scope to have direct access to these
  variables or functions.

<p><em>Functions and Pointers</em></p>
<p>Variables can be passed to a function through the function's list of parameters. The variables can be pass-by-value, where the function parameters
  take on the values of the variables. Or the variables can be pass-by-address, where the function parameters point to the memory addresses of these
  variables. If you want the function to change the values of any of these variable, those variables are pass-by-address.<br>
  For instance, <b>printf()</b> takes variables that are pass-by-value, since none of those variables will be changed by <b>printf()</b>.<br>
  However, <b>scanf()</b> takes variables that are pass-by-address, because <b>scanf()</b> will change the values of any of these variables passed to it.
